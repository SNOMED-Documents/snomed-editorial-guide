# Preferred Term

A  _preferred term (PT)_ is the description that is deemed to be the most clinically appropriate way of expressing a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Concept "Glossary link: Concept") in a clinical record. It represents a common word or phrase used by clinicians to name a concept in clinical practice or in the literature. It is the synonym that is  _preferred_ in a language or dialect.

The use of a description can vary between different languages, dialects and contexts. A description may be preferred in some dialects, acceptable in others, and may not be used in some dialects. A Language Reference Set is used to specify the descriptions that are preferred or acceptable in each language or dialect.

A concept may have two descriptions marked as PT, one for each language. 

For example, [ 32849002 | Esophageal structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/32849002 "32849002 | Esophageal structure \(body structure\) |") has

  *     * PT: Esophageal structure (US)
    * PT: Oesophageal structure (GB)

A PT for one concept may also be a synonym for another concept.

For example, 

  *     * [ 84162001 | Cold sensation quality (qualifier value)|](http://snomed.info/id/84162001 "84162001 | Cold sensation quality \(qualifier value\) |") has a [preferred term](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/preferred+term) of  _cold_
    * [ 82272006 | Common cold (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/82272006 "82272006 | Common cold \(disorder\) |") also has a [synonym](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/synonym) of  _cold_

In both concepts,  _cold_ represents a common clinical phrase used to capture the meaning of the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept).

The PT is indicated by the acceptabilityId field, for a particular language or dialect.
