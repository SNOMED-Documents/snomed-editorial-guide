The body structure domain includes anatomical structures, as well as morphologic abnormalities, as follows:

  * Body structure (body structure)
    * Anatomical or acquired body structure (body structure)
    * Anatomical organizational pattern (body structure)
    * Anatomical site notations for tumor staging (body structure)
    * Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)
    * Nonspecific site (body structure)
    * Normal anatomy (body structure)
    * Topography not assigned (body structure)
    * Topography unknown (body structure)
