# Supporting hierarchy - Disposition

## Overview

The hierarchy, 726711005 |Disposition (disposition)|, was created to support the remodeling of the Substance hierarchy. The concepts in this hierarchy are used as the attribute value for the |Has disposition (attribute)| for concepts in the Substance hierarchy, to sufficiently define grouper concepts representing dispositions, and to sufficiently define concepts in other SNOMED CT hierarchies. To provide adequate context to differentiate concepts in this hierarchy from similar concepts in other existing SNOMED CT hierarchies, a new (disposition) semantic tag was created.

General Terming Guidelines  
The following words should be avoided unless specifically identified as an exception in the editorial guidelines.

  *     * agent
    * analog
    * and
    * and/or
    * content(s)
    * derivative
    * material
    * metabolite
    * modification
    * or
    * preparation
    * product
    * substance

Exceptions:

  *     * Alkylating agent (disposition)

Descriptions should be singular, not plural.  
  
  

**Disposition representing:**

  * receptor agonist or partial agonist
  * receptor antagonist or partial antagonist
  * enzyme inhibitor or  
enzyme system inhibitor
  * enzyme activator

| FSN| Patterns:

  * **_X_** receptor agonist (disposition)
  * **_X_** receptor antagonist (disposition)
  * **_X_** inhibitor (disposition)  

  * **_X_** activator (disposition)

Example of receptor agonist:

  * Dopamine receptor agonist (disposition)

  * Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (disposition)

Example of inhibitor (enzyme system):

  * Hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system inhibitor (disposition)
  * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (disposition)

Example of activator:

---|---|---  
Preferred Term| Patterns:

  * **_X_** receptor agonist
  * ** _X_** receptor antagonist

Example of receptor antagonist:

  * Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist
  * Histamine receptor antagonist
  * Opioid receptor antagonist

Example of enzyme inhibitor:

  * Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
  * Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor
  * Centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

Example of enzyme system inhibitor:

  * Proton pump inhibitor
  * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor

Example of enzyme inducer:

  * Plasminogen activator

Exceptions:

  * Preferred terms may reflect the common clinical description for a disposition.  

    * Example:
      * |Hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system inhibitor (disposition)| has Preferred Term |Proton pump inhibitor|
      * |3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (disposition)| has Preferred Term |HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor|
