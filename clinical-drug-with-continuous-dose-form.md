# Clinical Drug with Continuous Dose Form

## Overview

Clinical drugs representing continuous dose form (e.g., solutions, suspensions, creams, ointments, patches) are modeled using concentration strength attributes; presentation strength attributes are not allowed for these concepts in the International Release.

For example,

  *     * Product containing precisely zidovudine 10 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release oral solution (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely amikacin (as amikacin sulfate) 250 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release solution for injection (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely clotrimazole 10 milligram/1 gram conventional release cutaneous cream (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely mupirocin (as mupirocin calcium) 20 milligram/1 gram conventional release nasal ointment (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely buprenorphine 70 microgram/1 hour prolonged-release transdermal patch (clinical drug)

  *     * Concepts with product strength that is "not equal to" (e.g. with product strength expressed as a range, greater than, or less than) are primitive

  
**Attribute:****Has manufactured dose form**|  Range: 736542009 |Pharmaceutical dose form (dose form)|

  *     *       * While the allowed range for this attribute is broader, the CD-precise continuous dose from concepts should only use <736542009 | Pharmaceutical dose form (dose form), excluding grouper concepts based on intended site (e.g. 740596000 |Cutaneous dose form (dose form)|, 385268001 |Oral dose form (dose form)|).

Cardinality: 1..1Powder and granules for oral suspension, solution, etc., may be modeled using concentration strength and the administrable dose form (e.g. 1145409004 |Product containing precisely amoxicillin 25 milligram/1 milliliter and clavulanic acid (as clavulanate potassium) 6.25 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release oral suspension (clinical drug)|)  
**Attribute:****Count of base of active ingredient (attribute)**|  Concrete Type: IntegerRange: >#0..Cardinality: 1..1  
Relationship group| One relationship group containing one instance of each of the following attributes is required for each precise active ingredient.  
  
  * Has precise active ingredient

| Range: <105590001 |Substance (substance) excluding concepts representing structural groupers, dispositions, or combined substancesCardinality: 1..1 per relationship group

  * The Precise Active Ingredient (PAI) cannot be modeled as a substance hydrate or solvate unless the BoSS is expressed as a hydrate or solvate.
  * Concepts containing pancreatic enzymes will be modeled based on the discrete enzymes; because of variability between real clinical drugs, synonyms representing a total amount in a particular product will not be included in the International Release.

  
  
  * Has basis of strength substance

| Range: <105590001 |Substance (substance) excluding concepts representing structural groupers, dispositions, or combined substancesCardinality: 1..1 per relationship group  
  
  * Has concentration strength numerator value

| Concrete Type: DecimalRange: >#0..Cardinality: 1..1 per relationship group  
  
  * Has concentration strength numerator unit

| Range: <767524001 |Unit of measure (qualifier value)|Cardinality: 1..1 per relationship group  
  
  * Has concentration strength denominator value

| Concrete Type: DecimalRange: >#0..Cardinality: 1..1 per relationship groupFor this pattern, the attribute value must be 1.The denominator strength value is required for concepts in the International Release even though the value = 1, because including denominators for only some concepts negatively affects the classification results.  
  
  * Has concentration strength denominator unit

| Range: <767524001 |Unit of measure (qualifier value)|Cardinality: 1..1 per relationship group  
For Clinical drug concepts with:

  * liquid dose form: the denominator unit should be 258773002 |Milliliter (qualifier value)|.
  * semi-solid dose form: the denominator unit should be [ 258682000 | gram (qualifier value)|](http://snomed.info/id/258682000 "258682000 | gram \(qualifier value\) |") for weight/weight concentration and 258773002 |Milliliter (qualifier value)| for weight/volume concentration. Representing semi-solid dose forms in weight/weight concentration is preferred.

  
  
## Naming

Use one of the following patterns for the FSN and PT. 

FSN| **Where Precise active ingredient = BoSS:**

  * Product containing precisely <BoSS FSN> <Concentration strength numerator value FSN> <Concentration strength numerator unit FSN>/<Concentration strength denominator value FSN> <Concentration strength denominator unit FSN> <Manufactured dose form FSN> (clinical drug)

For example,

  *     *       * Product containing precisely amitriptyline hydrochloride 5 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release oral solution (clinical drug)
      * Product containing precisely buprenorphine 70 microgram/1 hour prolonged-release transdermal patch (clinical drug)
      * Product containing precisely clotrimazole 10 milligram/1 gram conventional release cutaneous cream (clinical drug)
      * Product containing precisely zidovudine 10 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release oral solution (clinical drug)
      * Product containing precisely lopinavir 80 milligram/1 milliliter and ritonavir 20 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release oral solution (clinical drug)  

**Where Precise active ingredient is not = BoSS:**

  * Product containing precisely <BoSS FSN> (as <Precise active ingredient FSN>) <Concentration strength numerator value FSN> <Concentration strength numerator unit FSN>/<Concentration strength denominator value FSN> <Concentration strength denominator unit FSN> <Manufactured dose form FSN> (clinical drug)

For example,

  *     *       * Product containing precisely amikacin (as amikacin sulfate) 250 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release solution for injection (clinical drug)
      * Product containing precisely mupirocin (as mupirocin calcium) 20 milligram/1 gram conventional release nasal ointment (clinical drug)

  
---|---  
Preferred Term| **Where Single ingredient with BoSS = Precise active ingredient:**

  * <BoSS PT> <Concentration strength numerator value PT> <Concentration strength numerator unit PT>/<Concentration strength denominator value PT> <Concentration strength denominator unit PT> <Manufactured dose form PT>

For example,

  *     *       * Amitriptyline hydrochloride 5 mg/mL oral solution
      * Buprenorphine 70 microgram/hour prolonged-release transdermal patch
      * Clotrimazole 10 mg/g cutaneous cream
      * Zidovudine 10 mg/mL oral solution
      * Lopinavir 80 mg/mL and ritonavir 20 mg/mL oral solution

**Where Single ingredient with BoSS is not = Precise active ingredient:**

  * <BoSS PT> (as <Precise active ingredient PT>) <Concentration strength numerator value PT> <Concentration strength numerator unit PT>/<Concentration strength denominator value PT> <Concentration strength denominator unit PT> <Manufactured dose form PT>

For example,

  *     *       * Amikacin (as amikacin sulfate) 250 mg/mL solution for injection
      * Mupirocin (as mupirocin calcium) 20 mg/g nasal ointment

  
Synonyms| Synonyms converting metric units to percent or parts per millions may be included for medical gas concepts (e.g. Helium 79% and oxygen 21% gas for inhalation, Helium 790,000 ppm and oxygen 210,000 ppm gas for inhalation).
