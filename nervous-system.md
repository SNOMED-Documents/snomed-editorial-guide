# Nervous System

The nervous system has two parts, central and peripheral.

  * The central nervous system, sometimes also called the  _neuraxis_ , consists of the brain and spinal cord. The pyramidal system is a subdivision of the central nervous system; the extrapyramidal system is part of the brain. 
  * The peripheral nervous system includes all neural structures outside the central nervous system. 

The nervous system is also divided as: autonomic, somatic, and enteric.

  * The autonomic system is further divided as sympathetic and parasympathetic. The autonomic system is not entirely a part of the peripheral nervous system, but the autonomic nerves are peripheral.

## Nerve

The word  _nerve_ has multiple meanings according to the FMA:

  * nerve trunk
  * neural organ (trunk plus branches, excluding nuclei, ganglia, and roots)
  * neural tree organ, including nuclei, ganglia, roots, etc.

A  _neural tree organ_ is defined in FMA as  _a nonparenchymatous organ which has as its parts an aggregate of neurons (nuclei or ganglia) and their axons which are grouped into fasciculi by connective tissue to form elongated, cable-like structures that are arranged into a tree_. A  _nerve_ , according to FMA, is defined as  _a segment of a neural tree organ which has as its parts a nerve trunk and its branches; together with other nerves of the same tree, it constitutes a neural tree._ The neural tree structure includes:

  * Cranial nerve
    * Complex cranial nerve-tract
  * Spinal nerve
  * Spinal accessory nerve (strictly neither cranial or spinal nerves)
  * Peripheral nerve
  * Autonomic nerve

 _Nerve_ , conventionally has two meanings:

  * An anatomically distinct nerve trunk (without branches) that is identified in a dissection (e.g. the structure that student identifies when a pin is placed in the trunk of the vagus nerve, for instance located on the arch of the aorta)
  * A larger anatomical entity which supports a related set of functions (e.g. all anatomical components of the vagus nerve that are necessary for it to execute its functions (e.g. when a student is asked which nerve is responsible for slowing the heart the answer,  _the vagus nerve_ , includes the vagal nucleus, as well as the trunk and branches of the vagus). 
  * Neural tree designates the second concept in order to distingiush it from the first which is only a part (subdivision of) the vagal neural tree.

A third meaning of nerve, defined by the FMA is:  _Segment of neural tree organ which has as its parts a nerve trunk and its branches; together with other nerves of the same tree it constitutes a neural tree_.

For example,

  *     * Chorda tympani, digastric branch of facial nerve, greater petrosal nerve, posterior cutaneous branch of posterior ramus of cervical nerve, superior lateral cutaneous nerve of arm.
    * If one severs the facial nerve, the meaning refers to the trunk. But if one has facial nerve palsy, the meaning refers to the entire distribution of the nerve and the functions served by it.

There were several concepts with the phrase  _x nerve and its branches,_ interpreted as meaning _ the entire nerve and its branches._ Therefore,  _x nerve and its branches_ would be a duplicate of  _entire x nerve_ , when we interpret  _entire x nerve_ as being a neural tree organ.

For example,

  *     * _Entire facial nerve_ is a neural tree organ, so there is no need for an additional concept called  _facial nerve and its branches_. 
    *  _Entire cranial nerve_ is a neural tree organ and  _structure of cranial nerve_ is that organ or any part (or branch) thereof. Branches of the cranial and spinal nerves are segments of the neural tree organs from which they branch. 

All concepts named  _nerve x and its branches_ were inactivated due to their ambiguity. There are  _MAY BE A_ links to  _structure of nerve x_ , and  _entire nerve x_.**** Specifying  _trunk of a nerve_ requires a specific concept.

## Supratentorial brain

Cerebrum may refer to the  _supratentorial brain,_ which is everything except the midbrain, medulla, pons, and cerebellum. In this interpretation, the telencephalon and diencephalon are in the cerebrum. On the other hand, cerebrum may only refer to the parts derived embryologically from the telencephalon, the cerebral hemispheres and the intercerebral commissure (corpus callosum and anterior commissure).

_Supratentorial brain_ may be used for categorizing tumors and for designating the location of swelling that can result in herniation. The telencephalon and diencephalon (including thalamus, geniculate bodies, pineal body, habenulae, and hypothalamus) are definitely supratentorial. The upper part of the midbrain (mesencephalon) is also supratentorial. SNOMED CT excludes all midbrain structures from the supratentorial brain.
