# Respiratory System

## Respiratory tract

[321667001 |Respiratory tract structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/321667001). In SNOMED CT,  _respiratory tract_ has the same meaning as the  _Nomina Anatomica_ term  _apparatus respiratorius_ , which includes the structures through which air passes from the nares to the alveoli. The  _oral cavity_ is not included. In common usage,  _respiratory system_ may have the same meaning as  _respiratory tract_ ; but not in SNOMED CT.  _Respiratory system_ does not mean  _the global respiratory system_ that might include the CNS components of breathing.  _Pleura_ are part of the lower respiratory system, but not a part of the lower respiratory tract.

## Upper aerodigestive tract

This phrase has several meanings. The SNOMED CT concepts [119253004 |Upper aerodigestive tract structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/119253004) and [361922007 |Entire upper aerodigestive tract (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/361922007) have the meaning based on the following reference:  _Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract constitute approximately 4% of all malignancies. These include cancer of the lip, tongue, major salivary glands, gums and adjacent oral cavity tissues, floor of the mouth, tonsils, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx and other oral regions, nasal cavity, accessory sinuses, middle ear, and larynx_(Upper aerodigestive tract cancers, Cancer 1995 Jan 1;75 (1 Suppl): 147-53). This definition matches the tumors included in the  _CAP Cancer Checklist_ for upper aerodigestive tumors. The esophagus, or at least the cervical esophagus, may be included, but not in SNOMED CT _._

## Upper respiratory tract

[58675001 |Upper respiratory tract structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/58675001) includes the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx

## Lower respiratory tract

[82094008 |Lower respiratory tract structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/82094008) includes the tracheobronchial tree (from the trachea through the terminal bronchioles) and the lungs, including the alveolar respiratory tract (which extends from the respiratory bronchioles to the alveoli).

## Lower respiratory system

[400141005 |Lower respiratory system structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/400141005) includes the lower respiratory tract and the pleura.

## Interarytenoid fold or larynx

The interarytenoid fold forms part of the inlet of the larynx. The fold has two surfaces, one forming part of the wall of the supraglottic larynx, the other forming part of the wall of the hypopharynx (the  _food tube_ behind the larynx, leading to the esophagus). The [102295003 |Structure of hypopharyngeal aspect of interarytenoid fold (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/102295003) may be considered __ part of the hypopharynx, the larynx, or both. A tumor of this site is categorized as a tumor of the hypopharynx, and not the larynx, but the [105585004 |Interarytenoid fold structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/105585004) is considered part of the larynx.

SNOMED CT does not give a  _Part of_ relationship between the hypopharyngeal aspect of the interarytenoid fold and the interarytenoid fold. This emphasizes SNOMED CT modeling based on the relationship of anatomical entities and disorders and procedures and not simply by reading term names.

## Nasal turbinates

SNOMED CT differentiates between the bone underlying the nasal turbinates and the actual turbinates:

Bones underlying the turbinates,

  *     * [118648008 |Inferior nasal turbinate bone structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/118648008)
    * [122491002 |Middle nasal turbinate bone structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/122491002)
    * [122492009 |Superior nasal turbinate bone structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/122492009)
    * [122493004 |Supreme nasal turbinate bone structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/122493004)

Turbinates, which include bone, overlying mucous membranes, and other tissue,

  *     * [6553002 |Inferior nasal turbinate structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/6553002)
    * [122491002 |Middle nasal turbinate bone structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/122491002)
    * [65289004 |Superior nasal turbinate structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/65289004)
    * [33415007 |Supreme nasal turbinate structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/33415007)

The [ 118648008 |Inferior nasal turbinate bone structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/118648008) is a facial bone and skull bone. And, parts of the ethmoid bone form the middle, superior, and supreme nasal conchae. This means that the bones of the middle, superior, and supreme turbinates are not bone organs.
