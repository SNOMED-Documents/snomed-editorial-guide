# Diagnostic Imaging for Multiple Body Sites

## Adjacent structures

Concepts which describe adjacent structures, imaged in one procedure, are acceptable.

For example,

  *     * [ 432672003 | Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvis and hip (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/432672003 "432672003 | Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvis and hip \(procedure\) |")

Multiple procedures or a combination of different procedures in one concept are unacceptable.

Unacceptable examples,

  *     * Computed tomography angiography of aorta, abdomen, pelvis and lower limb
    * Ultrasonography of abdomen and ultrasonography of pelvis with transrectal ultrasonography
    * Ultrasonography of pelvis and obstetric ultrasonography with transvaginal ultrasonography
    * Ultrasonography of knee and Doppler ultrasonography of vein of lower limb
