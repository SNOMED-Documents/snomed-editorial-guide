# Surgical vs. non-surgical

As mentioned in the initial Surgical procedures page, the definition of surgical procedure includes  _intentional non-transient alteration of structures of the body and/or necessarily involves cutting into the body_. 

Non-surgical actions do not significantly or non-transiently alter anatomy and do not necessarily involve cutting or incision.

For example,

  *     * Fine needle biopsy (procedure) or brush biopsy (procedure)
    * Phlebotomy, a synonym for venipuncture for blood test (procedure)
    * Aspiration (procedure)
    * Closed reduction of dislocation (procedure)

Closed procedure naming

  * The general pattern <open, closed> <procedure> is accepted
  * When a procedure is specified as closed, the closed procedure should be fully described, e.g. fine needle biopsy, endoscopic, etc.
