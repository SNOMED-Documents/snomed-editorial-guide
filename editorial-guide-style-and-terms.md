# Editorial Guide Style and Terms

To provide consistency and clarity, there has been an effort to use certain styles and specific terms within the Editorial Guide.

Although this has been the intent, it is the content of the Guide that has been the focus. Consequently, authors may find instances where alternative styles or terms are used.
