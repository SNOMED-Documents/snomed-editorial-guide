## Choroid

Both  _subchoroidal_ and  _suprachoroidal_ refer to the same potential anatomic space between the choroid and the sclera. The term  _lamina subchoroidea of choroid_ is the same as the  _lamina suprachoroidea_.

In the literature, the term  _massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage_ is replacing  _expulsive hemorrhage_ and  _subchoroidal hemorrhage_.

## Retinal vein

There is not a vein actually named  _retinal vein_. However,  _SNOMED CT_ has concepts with the phrase.

For example,

  *     * [85003000 |Structure of retinal vein (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/85003000) has the synonym  _retinal vein_.
    * [280927000 |Entire central vein of the retina (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/280927000) has the synonym  _entire central retinal vein._

## Orbital region

[371398005 |Eye region structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/371398005) has a synonym of  _orbital region structure_ which subsumes  _bony orbit_ ,  _entire_  _eye_ , and  _ocular adnexa_.
