# Morphologic Abnormality Modeling

The morphologic abnormality subhierarchy is located two levels below the Body structure hierarchy with siblings _Apoptosis_ and _Structure resulting from tissue repair process_ :

* SNOMED CT concept
  * Body structure (body structure)
    * Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)
      * Apoptosis (morphologic abnormality)
      * Morphologically abnormal structure (morphologic abnormality)
      * Structure resulting from tissue repair process (morphologic abnormality)

The concepts in the morphologic abnormality hierarchy represent abnormal body structures.

The subhierarchy of 118956008 |Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)| is to remain primitive. Authors are not to define morphologic abnormality concepts.
