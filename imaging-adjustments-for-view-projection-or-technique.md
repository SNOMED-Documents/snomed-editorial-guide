# Imaging Adjustments for View, Projection, or Technique

It may be important, from both clinical and administrative perspectives, to capture variations or modifications of imaging technique. The variations may impact correct acquisition and interpretation of images.

Examples of modifications include:

  *     * Axial (qualifier value)
    * Skyline projection (qualifier value)
    * Decubitus (qualifier value)

Though these examples are qualifying values in  _SNOMED CT_ , they are not allowable for post-coordination of diagnostic imaging procedures.
