# Surgical procedures

A  _surgical procedure_ is defined as a procedure that involves intentional non-transient alteration of structures of the body, and/or a procedure that necessarily involves cutting into the body. This definition includes all procedures defined by  _Method_ (attribute) with Surgical action (qualifier value).

SNOMED CT classifies concepts as surgical procedures if their methods are  _surgical actions_ based on the action hierarchy. The surgical action hierarchy distinguishes surgical from non-surgical actions based on the definition above. Note the  _Or_ in the sentence; actions that do not involve cutting or incision, but do involve the intentional non-transient alteration of anatomy, are still surgical.

In SNOMED CT,  _operation_ is synonymous with surgical procedure.

Surgical procedures are not defined simply as procedures done by a surgeon (despite some dictionary definitions). Surgeons can perform many non-surgical actions and surgical procedures need not necessarily be performed by a surgeon, i.e. if a non-surgeon performs a surgical procedure, it is still a surgical procedure.

The use of the term _medical procedure_ is deprecated, i.e. not recommended, because it lacks reproducible meaning. It might be defined as  _a procedure done by a physician_ , but even that is deprecated, because it is provider-specific.
