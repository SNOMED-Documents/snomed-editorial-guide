## Naming

  * Use _antivenom_ , not _antivenin_ , for FSNs and Preferred Terms. Synonyms containing _antivenin_ are not created routinely but may be created upon request. 
  * FSNs should be based on the scientific name if there is a one-to-one correspondence. Naming conventions for polyvalent antivenoms (effective against multiple organisms) will not comply with this naming convention and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Preferred Terms are based on the common name.
  * Synonyms based on the scientific name should be created in most cases.

  *     * When there is no common name for the organism, the PT will match the FSN

For example,

  *     *       * Chironex fleckeri antivenom

  

  * Additional synonyms (e.g. when other legitimate synonyms exist for Organism name) are applicable and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis

For example,

  *     *       * Deadly sea wasp antivenom
