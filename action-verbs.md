# Action Verbs

Action verbs should be written in noun form within SNOMED CT descriptions. This most often means the root form of the verb will end with a suffix of –tion, -sion, -ment, -al, -ence, or -ance.

For example,

  *     * _Destruction_ instead of destroy
    *  _Incision_ instead of incise
    *  _Replacement_ instead of replace
    *  _Removal_ instead of remove
    *  _Maintenance_ instead of maintain

However, the root form of the verb may be used when it does not make a word when ending in noun suffixes.

For example,

  *     * _Control_
    *  _Release_
    *  _Care_

Lastly, the verb with a suffix of –ing may be used when the root form of the verb may cause ambiguity in the meaning, i.e. the root form of the verb could also be a physical object.

For example,

  *     * _Wiring_ instead of wire
    *  _Suturing_ instead of suture
    *  _Splinting_ instead of splint
    *  _Mapping_ instead of map
    *  _Grafting_ instead of graft

Exceptions,

Common usage may dictate some exceptions.

For example,

  *     * _Repair_ instead of repairment

Although ‘repairment’ may be considered a valid word, its use has fallen out of common usage in comparison to ‘repair’.

## Past tense

A past tense verbal phrase should not be used to name a procedure, since it indicates that the procedure was done in the past.

Unacceptable example, 

  *     *  _Hand tendon ganglion excised_ indicates the procedure was done, as a past tense declarative statement. 

However, the following is an acceptable example using a noun phrase, 

  *     * [ 11227005 | Excision of ganglion of tendon sheath of hand (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/11227005 "11227005 | Excision of ganglion of tendon sheath of hand \(procedure\) |")

Existing descriptions containing past tense verbs should be moved to the [ 243796009 | Situation with explicit context (situation)|](http://snomed.info/id/243796009 "243796009 | Situation with explicit context \(situation\) |") hierarchy.
