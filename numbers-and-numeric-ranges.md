# Numbers and Numeric Ranges

## Roman numerals versus Arabic numbers

Use the most common representation found in literature for the fully specified name. Use the alternative representation as a synonym, if it is also represented in the literature. If neither representation is common, use the Arabic representation.   

For example, in the  _AMA Manual of Style,_ cancer stages are expressed with the use of capital Roman numerals: stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IV. The term, "stage 0", usually indicates carcinoma in situ. Histologic grades are expressed with Arabic numerals, e.g., grade 2.

## Numeric ranges

In general, content that depends on numeric ranges should not be used for precoordination.

For example,

  *     * There may be too many possibilities
      * A finding of number of lesions might have ranges of _1_ , _2 to 5_ , and _greater than 5_ ;  _1 to 2_ , _3 to 10_ , and _greater than 10_ , etc.
    * There may be possible changes to reference ranges or systems of units  

      * The normal serum sodium concentration is usually defined as 135 to 145 mEq/L. Low serum sodium should not use the phrase _serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L;_ it should use a phrase such as _serum sodium concentration below reference range._
      * A body mass index (BMI) score as an indicator of obesity

A standard definition with a fixed numeric range may be acceptable, i.e., the range is an explanation or definition of the score.

For example,

  *     * A histologic scoring system with a score of _1_ when there are _0 to 5 mitoses per high power field_ , and a score of _2_ when there are _6 to 10_ , etc.
    * The Tumor, Node, Metastases (TNM) Classification of Malignant Tumor
