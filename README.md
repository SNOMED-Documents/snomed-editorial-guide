# Abscess

There are two types of abscesses: 

  1. septic
  2. sterile

Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are the result of an infection.

If a concept's meaning, based on its FSN and text definition, does not specify whether the abscess is sterile or septic, then the concept should not be modeled as septic. 

The concept's logical definition uses the Indirect morphology (attribute) of 44132006 |Abscess (morphologic abnormality)| and a Direct substance (attribute) of 11311000 |Pus (substance)|.
