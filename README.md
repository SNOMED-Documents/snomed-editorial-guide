# SNOMED CT Editorial Guide

The Editorial Guide provides the information necessary to model concepts in SNOMED CT. It is a working document, subject to change and revision. The primary audience is for those who edit content in the International Release _,_ but it may also be useful to those creating extensions. For those editing in extensions, please also see guidance within the [Extensions Practical Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/3RKZIWpWFT0ocCgNT16E/).

_**These guidelines should be applied to new content.  While there are many concepts in the existing content that are not in compliance with this guidance, the process of correcting existing content will be carried out as time and resources permit.**_

[Summary of changes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHZNeNQwkCcUPaZGEl28GFGv_WMTHZoeHeAV5cSjOFU/)\*

\*_Changes on this spreadsheet may include those in progress for a future publication date.  The in-progress changes are available for viewing but will not be visible in the Editorial Guide until the next publication.  Please note dates in bottom tab._ &#x20;

SNOMED CT is distributed in sets of electronic files. Supporting software tools are not necessarily provided directly by SNOMED International.

The Editorial Guide publishes only the rules that apply to precoordinated content. That is, the rules where the 'Content Type' is one of the following - |All SNOMED CT content|, |All precoordinated SNOMED CT content|, or |All new precoordinated SNOMED CT content|. The rules that are **not** published in the Editorial Guide are the ones that apply only to |All postcoordinated content|.  See the different content types and rules in the MRCM maintenance tool at [https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/mrcm](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/mrcm). &#x20;
