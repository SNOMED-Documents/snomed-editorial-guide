# Intended Use

SNOMED CT is intended to be used in healthcare:

  * To provide effective and comprehensive coverage of terms
  * As a terminological resource
  * For implementation in electronic health applications

The purpose of SNOMED CT is to represent clinically relevant information reliably and reproducibly in electronic health applications, (most often electronic health records or EHRs) to support:

  * Delivery of multidisciplinary, high-quality healthcare to individuals and populations 
  * Optimal retrieval, processing, and rendering of clinical information
  * Effective use of clinical information consistently and reproducibly
  * Use of clinical information for statistical and reporting purposes

  

## Semantic Interoperability

The overall semantic interoperability of electronic health applications __ is achieved through the combined functioning of the information architecture of the application and the terminology that populates it. A basic principle of SNOMED CT is to create and maintain semantic interoperability of clinical information.  _Semantic interoperability_ is the capability of two or more systems to communicate and exchange information. Each system should be able to interpret the meaning of, and effectively use, received information.__ To achieve this goal, the meaning of the information must be agreed upon, consistent, and clearly expressed.
