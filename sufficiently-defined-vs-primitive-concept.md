# Sufficiently Defined vs Primitive Concept

## Sufficiently defined

A [concept is sufficiently defined](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficiently+defined+concept) if its defining characteristics are adequate to define it relative to its immediate supertypes. A sufficiently defined concept is defined in the context of its hierarchy. See main glossary entry for [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition). 

## Primitive

A concept which is not sufficiently defined is  _primitive._ A [primitive concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/primitive+concept) is a formal logic definition that is inadequate to distinguish it from similar concepts. A primitive concept does not have enough defining relationships to computably distinguish it from more general concepts (supertypes).
