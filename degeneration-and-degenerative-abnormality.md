# Degeneration and Degenerative abnormality

A distinction should be made between [107669003 |Degenerative abnormality (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/107669003) and [33359002 |Degeneration (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/33359002). 

  * [33359002 |Degeneration (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/33359002) is a child of [ 107669003 |Degenerative abnormality (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/107669003).
  * [107669003 |Degenerative abnormality (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/107669003) is a grouper concept with members usually characterized by retrogressive pathologic structural changes. Diseases that are degenerative do not necessarily have [116676008 |Associated morphology (attribute)|](http://snomed.info/id/116676008) of [ 33359002 |Degeneration (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/33359002), since the word  _degenerative_ sometimes refers to loss of function rather than structural degeneration.

Examples include degeneration proper, as well as lysis, vascular sclerosis, necrosis, infarct, deposition, dystrophy, pigmentation, atrophy, and depletion.

  * Morphologies under degeneration also have retrogressive structural changes, but they are not necessarily any of the above, nor are they necessarily resorption, malacia, obliteration, opacity, plaque, or postmortem change (this seems to be definition by exclusion).
  * Necrosis is a degenerative abnormality, but not a degeneration. Necrosis can follow**** degeneration. 
  * Atrophy is a degenerative abnormality, but only  _atrophic degeneration_ is also a degeneration.
