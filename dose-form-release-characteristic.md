## Naming

**FSN**|  Use the following pattern for the FSN where X is the release characteristic, adding a hyphen when appropriate Combined release-characteristic concepts may be created to support modeling of concepts that display multiple release characteristics in a single formulation.

  * X (release characteristic)

For example,

  *     *       * Conventional release (release characteristic)
      * Delayed-release (release characteristic)
      * Prolonged-release (release characteristic)*
      * Modified-release (release characteristic)**
      * Delayed-release and prolonged-release (release characteristic)

*Prolonged was selected rather than Extended because feedback was received that it is more clear to translate for non-English speaking users; existing national drug extensions appear to use one or the other of these terms.**Modified-release is a grouper that is not allowed to be used to model an international _clinical drug_ concept.

**Preferred Term**|  Use the following pattern for the PT where X is the release characteristic, adding a hyphen when appropriate:

  * X**  
**

For example,

  *     *       * Conventional release
      * Delayed-release
      * Prolonged-release
      * Modified-release
      * Delayed-release and prolonged-release
