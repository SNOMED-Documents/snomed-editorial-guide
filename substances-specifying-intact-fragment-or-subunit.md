# Substances specifying intact, fragment or subunit

## Overview

Fragments are created as siblings of the intact/whole/entire substance.

“Intact” should not be included when referring to the "entire substance" or "whole substance"; it is implied.

Alpha and beta sub-units should be the children of the entire substance, where "nicked" substances and fragments should be the siblings.

INN should be used for the Preferred Term where they exist.
