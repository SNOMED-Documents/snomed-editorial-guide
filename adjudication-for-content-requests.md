# Adjudication for Content Requests

There are processes for making decisions about adding or changing content in SNOMED CT.

## Change requests

All change requests, whether for new content or for change to existing content, go through a request submission approval process. It involves review by authors to determine that there is:

  * International applicability
  * Compliance with Understandable, Reproducible, Useful (URU) principles
  * No duplication with existing content
  * No link to existing larger projects, as detailed in a Content Tracker document
  * No conflict with existing collaboration agreements (e.g. _Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)_ agreement)

  

Legacy concepts, i.e. concepts not in the current draft/work-in-progress version of SNOMED CT, may not follow current guidelines. Requests based on legacy concepts are unacceptable.

## Appeals, deferrals, and resolution

### Appeals

Requests that are rejected may be appealed by the submitter.

### Deferrals

Requests may be deferred for a number of reasons including questions about:

  * How to model the concept; which attributes may be used
  * Concept meaning
  * Literature reference missing or inadequate
  * Use case unclear
  * Size of required change (attached to a Content Tracker)

### Resolution

Resolution of deferrals may result in a decision delay requiring:

  * A larger project or work item or
  * Referral, internally, to other groups for decision. This depends on the complexity of the request and understanding of the wider impact.

## Results

Results of adjudication are received by email from the Content Request System (CRS). Simpler issues can be resolved expeditiously (e.g. by a ruling from the Chief Terminologist).
