# Introduction to the SNOMED CT Editorial Guide

## Background

SNOMED CT is a comprehensive, international, logic-based reference terminology designed to represent clinically relevant information in a consistent, computable way. Originating from the union of NHS Clinical Terms Version 3 and SNOMED RT, it has evolved to support contemporary clinical practice and technological advances . The Editorial Guide exists to support the ongoing development and quality assurance of this terminology, ensuring content is modeled consistently and in alignment with best practices .

## Purpose

The Editorial Guide provides the rules, conventions, and principles required to model SNOMED CT concepts. It serves as the definitive reference for authoring and maintaining content in the International Release, while also supporting extension creators . The guide ensures that terminology is reliable, unambiguous, and interoperable for healthcare applications.

## Scope

This guide covers the editorial policies for precoordinated content, meaning concepts and rules applicable to all precoordinated SNOMED CT content. Rules specific only to postcoordinated content are not included; these are managed separately through the MRCM ([Machine Readable Concept Model](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/mrcm)) browser . It also provides information on concept modeling, naming conventions, inactivation, attributes, and rules for specific hierarchies.

Text that is protected by copyright will not be accepted for inclusion unless accompanied by a release from the copyright holder.

## Audience

The primary audience of the Editorial Guide is SNOMED International editors responsible for maintaining the International Release. However, it is also relevant for extension developers, implementers, and others involved in clinical terminology management . For national or local extensions, the [Extensions Practical Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/3RKZIWpWFT0ocCgNT16E/) offers complementary guidance.
