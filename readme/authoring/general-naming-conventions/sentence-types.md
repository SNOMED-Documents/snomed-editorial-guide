# Sentence Types

Concepts should be names or short noun phrases. Full statements or sentences are unacceptable.

Procedure concepts should not contain phrases that can be categorized as a sentence function type, i.e., imperative, declarative, interrogative, or exclamatory. A procedure description should be a noun phrase that names the procedure, and should not contain information that it was done, or is to be ordered, carried out, or planned.

* For example,
  * 11227005 | Excision of ganglion of tendon sheath of hand (procedure)| is a noun phrase giving the proper description for the procedure
* Unacceptable example,
  * Hand tendon ganglion excised (situation) indicates the procedure was done, as a past tense declarative statement

This is a situation with explicit context, not a procedure.
