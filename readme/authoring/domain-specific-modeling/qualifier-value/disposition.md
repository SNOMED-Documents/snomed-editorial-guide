The [ 726711005 | Disposition (disposition)|](http://snomed.info/id/726711005 "726711005 | Disposition \(disposition\) |") hierarchy is required to support the remodeling of the [ 105590001 | Substance (substance)|](http://snomed.info/id/105590001 "105590001 | Substance \(substance\) |") hierarchy.

The (disposition) semantic tag is used to differentiate concepts in this hierarchy from similar concepts in other hierarchies.
