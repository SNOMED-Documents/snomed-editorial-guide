# Technique

272394005 | Technique (qualifier value) |

A technique (also called _method_) is a particular way of performing an activity or task.

While a technique describes _how_ a specific observation is performed, it should generally not include specific details about what is being observed, i.e., it should not include a component, specimen type, body site, etc.

Information about _what_ is being observed would be included in a separate attribute of the Observable entity model. [Observable Entity Defining Attributes](../observable-entity/observable-entity-defining-attributes.md) provides more details about modeling of observables using various attributes.
