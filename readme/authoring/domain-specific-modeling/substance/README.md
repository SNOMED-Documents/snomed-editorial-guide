# Substance

| Definition | Examples  |
| ---------- | --------- |
| The        | Substance |

## General Assumptions and Requirements

Decisions regarding requirements, applicable use cases, scope, terming, and modeling guidelines are made based on requests submitted by user community and in consultation with subject matter experts, associated Project Groups, and relevant credible references.

Top level concepts in the hierarchy will primarily be grouper concepts for both the stated and inferred views.

Concepts representing dispositions in the |Substance| hierarchy shall be sufficiently defined using proximal primitive modeling methodology unless explicitly noted as an exception in the editorial guidelines.

## Scope of Content

This section applies to the |Substance| hierarchy in the International Release:

### Scope

| Substances that support the modeling of concepts in other SNOMED CT hierarchies including but are not limited to: Medicinal product, Clinical finding, Procedure, Observable Entity, and Specimen                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| <p>Concepts that represent a combination of two or more separate substances</p><p></p><p>• Existing instances have been inactivated. Changes to SNOMED CT concept model to permit the use of concepts within the products hierarchy (e.g., vaccine products) as well as use of General Concept Inclusion functionality to model disorder and findings concepts means that these combined substances concepts will no longer be required. Requests for new instances will be rejected.</p> |
| <p>Concepts representing genetic engineering process variations such as Somatropin (epr), Somatropin (rbe), or Somatropin (rmc) are out of scope as SNOMED CT does not generally differentiate substances based on production process.</p><p></p><p>•Existing instances will be inactivated.
