# Substances specifying physical state or physical form

## Overview

Concepts specifying a particular physical state (e.g. liquid, solid, fumes, vapor, crystal, foam) of a substance should be represented as the sibling for the unspecified substance and also have a parent concept that relates to the structure of the substance.

Concepts specifying a particular physical form (e.g. micronized, macrocrystal, microsphere) should have a parent concept that relates to the structure of the substance and also an Is modification of (attribute) relationship to the unspecified substance concept.

## Naming

Fumes should be expressed in the plural (i.e. fumes as opposed to fume).

Fumes and vapor are different and so should not be used as synonyms on the same concept. [https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/gases-vapours-smoke-and-fumes](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/gases-vapours-smoke-and-fumes)
