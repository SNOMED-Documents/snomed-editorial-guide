# Fractionated and unfractionated substances

## Overview

Substance concepts that contain terms such as “fractionated” or “unfractionated” are not created in the Substance hierarchy. "Unfractinated" should not be included when referring to the "entire substance" or "whole substance"; it is implied. "Fractionated" usually refers to a separation technique or process.
