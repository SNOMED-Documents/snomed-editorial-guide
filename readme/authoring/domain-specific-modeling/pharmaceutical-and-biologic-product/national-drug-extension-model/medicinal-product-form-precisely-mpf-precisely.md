# Medicinal Product Form Precisely (MPF precisely)

## **Medicinal Product Form Precisely (****MPF precisely****)**

This concept class, which is not shown in any of the overall diagrams in the introductory page, would be a representation of a medicinal product based on description of only and exclusively the precise active ingredient(s) it contains and on the (generalised) intended site of use for the product. For example, "Product containing precisely amoxicillin trihydrate in oral dosage form" represents products that must contain only amoxicillin trihydrate (not amoxicillin sodium or amoxicillin base) as the precise ingredient substance, with no other active ingredients in manufactured dose forms such as oral suspension, oral capsule (any type), oral tablet (any type). This class is not part of the international edition, but may be of use in national extensions. It would be modelled in the same way as the MPF only, but would use the precise active ingredient attribute and the two additional ingredient count attributes if and when required, using the same rules as for MP precisely.
