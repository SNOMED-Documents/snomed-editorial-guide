# Groupers Based on Multiple Dispositions, Structures

## Overview

Groupers comprised of two or more existing disposition and/or structure groupers that can be sufficiently defined may be included in the |Medicinal product| hierarchy. High-level grouper concepts support the organization of the combined groupers based on disposition and/or structure:

* 766779001 |Medicinal product categorized by disposition (product)|
* 763760008 |Medicinal product categorized by structure (product)|

For some medicinal products, their clinical usefulness is related to the combination of both their structure and their disposition; it is the structure that produces the disposition.

For example,

* Clemastine is a substance whose anti-histamine behaviour is based upon its structure being ethanolamine derived.

Since structure-based grouping and disposition are characteristics of the active ingredient substance(s) present in the medicinal product, combined 'structure and disposition grouping' concepts are inferred by the classifier to medicinal products and include all their child concepts (medicinal product form and clinical drug concepts), although in a browser, the inferred grouping concepts are shown on the proximal concept only (the "medicinal product containing" concept).
