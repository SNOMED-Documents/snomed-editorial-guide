# Clinical Drug with Continuous Dose Form

## Overview

Clinical drugs representing a continuous dose form are modeled using _concentration_ strength attributes. Clinical drugs with a _continuous_ dose form using _concentration_ strength represents a medicinal product based on description of 1) its precise active ingredient substances only and explicitly, 2) the stated basis of strength substance(s) with strength, expressed as concentration strength and 3) with its manufactured dose form (with the exception of reconstituted oral liquid preparations, where the administrable dose form is be used as it is the most clinically relevant).

This is used for product types such as cutaneous semi-solids (without metered actuation), solutions, suspensions, creams, ointments, bulk powders and granules, topical liquids (without metered actuation) including drops, oral liquids, nebuliser liquids and liquid parenteral products.

For example,

* ```
  * Product containing precisely zidovudine 10 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release oral solution (clinical drug)
  ```
  * Product containing precisely amikacin (as amikacin sulfate) 250 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release solution for injection (clinical drug)
  * Product containing precisely clotrimazole 10 milligram/1 gram conventional release cutaneous cream (clinical drug)
  * Product containing precisely mupirocin (as mupirocin calcium) 20 milligram/1 gram conventional release nasal ointment (clinical drug)
