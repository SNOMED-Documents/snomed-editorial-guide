# Medicinal Product

An abstract representation of a medicinal product without reference to its dose form or its strength.

The grouper 763158003 |Medicinal product (product)|, a stated descendant of |Pharmaceutical / biologic product (product)|, was created to support top-level hierarchy changes in the future but avoids removing, renaming, or repurposing the existing |Pharmaceutical / biologic product (product)| concept.

## General Assumptions and Requirements

| Assumption or Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The top level concepts in the hierarchy will primarily be sufficiently defined grouper concepts.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Any requirement to align to external standards or registries will be explicitly documented. Concept model will be compatible with ISO's Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) standards (where appropriate).                                       |
| Concepts shall be sufficiently defined using proximal primitive modeling methodology unless explicitly noted as an exception in the editorial guidelines.                                                                                                |
| Concept model supports neither universal restrictions nor nesting.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| <p>Content in the |Medicinal product| hierarchy in the International Release is not intended to: </p><p>-support prescribing use cases, but may be sufficient to do so for some implementations. </p><p>eliminate the need for a national extension.</p> |

## Out of Scope

* Age ranges (e.g., adult, pediatric, infant, junior, adolescent)
  * _Exception: Vaccine products MP-only concepts maybe modeled with Has target population (attribute) that specifies a target population._
* Adjuvants
* Allergy immunotherapy products
  * _Should be represented in a national extension because of the manufacturer-specific variability regarding standardization and expression of strength._
* Ayurvedic medicine
* Brand names
* Color (e.g., color of tablet, capsule, or solution)
* Composite products
* Excipients
* Flavors
* Investigational products/Products under development but not marketed in any member country
  * _Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis (e.g., adding investigational products that are being widely used in pandemic)._
* Medicinal product (MP) and Medicinal product form (MPF) concepts without Clinical drug (CD) descendants
  * _There are historical concepts that do not have descendant CDs; this is not a pattern that will continue moving forward (e.g., MPs and MPFs are not created unless needed to support classification of a CD)._
* Packs
* Products intended only for non-human use
* Products no longer marketed or available for sale
  * _Existing concepts representing products that are no longer marketed or available for sale will be retained as active concepts in the International Release. \_ Requests for new content will be considered for inclusion on a case-by-case basis._
* Relevant omissions (e.g., sugar-free, preservative-free)
* Routes of administration not explicitly represented
* Sterility
* Tall man lettering
  * _Descriptions that include tall man lettering \[partial capitalization of drug names to distinguish from similar sounding drugs] should be authored in a national or local extension._
* Traditional medicine products
