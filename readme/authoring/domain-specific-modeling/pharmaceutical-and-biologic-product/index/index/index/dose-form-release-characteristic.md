## Naming

### FSN

Use the following pattern for the FSN where X is the release characteristic, adding a hyphen when appropriate Combined release-characteristic concepts may be created to support modeling of concepts that display multiple release characteristics in a single formulation.

* X (release characteristic)

For example,

* Conventional release (release characteristic)
* Delayed-release (release characteristic)
* Prolonged-release (release characteristic)\*
* Modified-release (release characteristic)\*\*
* Delayed-release and prolonged-release (release characteristic)

\*Prolonged was selected rather than Extended because feedback was received that it is more clear to translate for non-English speaking users; existing national drug extensions appear to use one or the other of these terms.

\*\*Modified-release is a grouper that is not allowed to be used to model an international _clinical drug_ concept.

### Preferred Term

Use the following pattern for the PT where X is the release characteristic, adding a hyphen when appropriate:

X

For example,

* Conventional release
* Delayed-release
* Prolonged-release
* Modified-release
* Delayed-release and prolonged-release

### Synonym

Synonyms are not allowed unless explicitly identified as an exception in the Editorial Guidelines.

### Text Definitions
