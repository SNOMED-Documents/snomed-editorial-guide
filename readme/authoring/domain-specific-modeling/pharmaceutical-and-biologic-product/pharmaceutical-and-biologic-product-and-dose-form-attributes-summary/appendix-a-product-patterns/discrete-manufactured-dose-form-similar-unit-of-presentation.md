# Discrete manufactured dose form; similar unit of presentation

_Examples: various tablets, capsules, cachets, pessaries, suppositories, tampons_

The unit of presentation is usually a less granular term than the manufactured dose form, and often corresponds to the basic dose form.\
Strength is expressed as "per one unit of presentation" and the presentation strength and the concentration are exactly the same.
