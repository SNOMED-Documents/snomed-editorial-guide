# Continuous presentation: bounded by container; liquid/semi-solid dose forms; concentration strength required

_Examples: bulk parenteral solutions, insulins, patches_

The unit of presentation usually either uses the same word (even though it is a different concept) as the (package item) container, or the (package item) container is a more granular concept and the unit of presentation uses a less granular term. However, although presentation strength is expressed as "per one unit of presentation", the clinically relevant strength is the concentration strength, as almost all are used in individually calculated and variable amounts.\
Note that the unit of presentation is likely to be useful in description of the medicinal product concept at some level; insulin presented in a multi-dose vial will be used/administered differently from insulin presented in a cartridge for use within a "pen device".

### **Example 1: A pack of 5 cartridges each containing 1.5mL soluble human insulin 100 units/mL solution for injection**
