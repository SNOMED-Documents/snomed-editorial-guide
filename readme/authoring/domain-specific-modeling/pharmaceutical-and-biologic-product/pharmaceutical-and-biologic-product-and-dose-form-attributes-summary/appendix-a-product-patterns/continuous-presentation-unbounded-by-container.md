# Continuous presentation: unbounded by container

_Examples: bulk powders and granules, bulk liquids, semi-solids_

These presentations are not particularly bound by their container in any way that is meaningful in terms of their use or administration; the Manufactured Item is a continuous presentation and almost all are used in individually calculated and variable amounts.

For example,

* Hydrocortisone cream for cutaneous use is contained in a tube, but its use is based on how much is squeezed out and applied to the skin.
* Chloramphenicol eye drops are presented in a dropper bottle, but they are administered drop by drop and although the dropper bottle aims to deliver a roughly uniform sized drop to the eye, they are not "metered dose containers" in the way that containers with valves are.

A unit of presentation is not usually given for these products. The pack size (not relevant for SNOMED international model) is given as the Manufactured Item quantity.\
Strength is expressed as a concentration and as such the presentation strength and the concentration are exactly the same.
