# Arrhythmia

Cardiologists noted confusion in the placement of _Conduction disorder of the heart (disorder)_ as a broad grouping that subsumed arrhythmias and heart blocks. In common usage _arrhythmia_ refers to a broad set of conditions that include conduction disorders, under which are heart blocks. The concept Cardiac arrhythmia (disorder) is a parent of Conduction disorder of the heart (disorder), and the active referent of the inactive concepts named _dysrhythmia_ or _arrhythmia_.

For example,

* Arrhythmias, like 72654001 |Supraventricular arrhythmia (disorder)|, are under 698247007 |Cardiac arrhythmia (disorder)|

Conduction disorders include heart block, AV block, bundle branch block, conduction delay, and conduction defect, like 418341009 | Atrioventricular conduction disorder (disorder) |. Other arrhythmias were moved from under 44808001 |Conduction disorder of the heart (disorder)| and placed under 698247007 |Cardiac arrhythmia (disorder)|.
