# Overdose

## Overdose of illicit drug

708079007 |Overdose of illicit drug (disorder)| is modeled without a Causative agent because the term "illicit drug" may have differing local interpretations.

## Vaccine-related overdose

Vaccine-related overdose concepts in the Clinical Finding/Disorder hierarchy were inactivated in the January 2020 Release. They were replaced with concepts in the Event hierarchy, see  [788094008 |Excessive dose of vaccine administered (event)|](http://snomed.info/id/788094008) and subtypes.

When authoring, determine whether the concept describes an overdose, which is a  _disorder_ , or the administration or ingestion of an excessive dose, which is an  _event_.
