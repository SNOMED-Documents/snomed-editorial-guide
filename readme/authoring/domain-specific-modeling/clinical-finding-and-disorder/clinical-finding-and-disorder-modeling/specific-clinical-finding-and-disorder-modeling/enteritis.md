# Enteritis

The term _enteritis_ is broad and commonly refers to inflammation of the intestine, especially the small intestine. However, in some conditions, e.g. phlegmonous enteritis and regional enteritis, the term _enteritis_ refers to any part of the digestive tract.

Thus, all descriptions of enteritis must stipulate the specific body structure that is affected to avoid potential misinterpretations and incorrect modeling.

For example,

* Enteritis of intestine
* Enteritis of small intestine
