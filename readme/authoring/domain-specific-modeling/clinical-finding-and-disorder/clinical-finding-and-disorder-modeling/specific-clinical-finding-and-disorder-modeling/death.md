# Death

_Death_ is an event, not a disorder. 

### Sudden cardiac death

 _Sudden cardiac death_ is a term used in clinical practice. It refers to an arrhythmia that results in sudden loss of cardiac function which, if not quickly reversed, will lead to  _actual_ death. The FSN Sudden cardiac death (disorder) is modeled as a subtype of [127337006 |Acute heart disease (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/127337006). It should not be classified as  _death._ Individuals with sudden cardiac death have not necessarily been declared  _dead_ and are frequently revived. It is regarded as a  _subtype_ of  _cardiac dysrhythmia_.
