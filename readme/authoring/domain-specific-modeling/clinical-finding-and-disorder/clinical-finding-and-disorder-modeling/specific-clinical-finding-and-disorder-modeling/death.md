# Death

_Death_ is an event, not a disorder.

### Sudden cardiac death

_Sudden cardiac death_ is a term used in clinical practice. It refers to an arrhythmia that results in sudden loss of cardiac function which, if not quickly reversed, will lead to _actual_ death. The FSN Sudden cardiac death (disorder) is modeled as a subtype of 127337006 |Acute heart disease (disorder)|. It should not be classified as _death._ Individuals with sudden cardiac death have not necessarily been declared _dead_ and are frequently revived. It is regarded as a _subtype_ of _cardiac dysrhythmia_.
