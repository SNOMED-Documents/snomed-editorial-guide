# Combining Morphologic Abnormalities

When modeling a concept requiring two role groups with the same body structure but two different morphologies (because a combined morphology does not exist), then those morphologic abnormalities can be combined to create a single morphologic abnormality concept. Keep the newly-created morphologic abnormality concept primitive, as all morphologic abnormality concepts are primitive.

| For example,                          |                                                                         |                                    |                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Disorder concept                      | Associated morphology                                                   | Associated morphology              | Combined Associated morphology               |
| Calcified hematoma of head (disorder) | Pathologic calcification, calcified structure (morphologic abnormality) | Hematoma (morphologic abnormality) | Calcified hematoma (morphologic abnormality) |

Another example is [1076491000119102 |Nontraumatic complete rupture of muscle or tendon structure of rotator cuff of left shoulder (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/1076491000119102).

If this disorder had the same finding site of |Structure of rotator cuff of left shoulder (body structure)| with two different morphologic abnormalities of |Nontraumatic rupture| and |Complete rupture|, then those two morphologic abnormality concepts can be combined to create a single, primitive, morphologic abnormality concept of |Nontraumatic complete rupture (morphologic abnormality)|. This will prevent modeling with two relationship groups.
