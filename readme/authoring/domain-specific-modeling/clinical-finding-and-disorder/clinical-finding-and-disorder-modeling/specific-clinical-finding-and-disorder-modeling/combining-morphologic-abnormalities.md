# Combining Morphologic Abnormalities

When modeling a concept requiring two role groups with the same body structure but two different morphologies (because a combined morphology does not exist), then those morphologic abnormalities can be combined to create a single morphologic abnormality concept. Keep the newly-created morphologic abnormality concept primitive, as all morphologic abnormality concepts are primitive.

**For example**

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th width="222.65966796875"></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Disorder concept</td><td>Associated morphology</td><td>Associated morphology</td><td>Combined Associated morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Calcified hematoma of head (disorder)</td><td>Pathologic calcification, calcified structure (morphologic abnormality)</td><td>Hematoma (morphologic abnormality)</td><td>Calcified hematoma (morphologic abnormality)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Another example is 1076491000119102 |Nontraumatic complete rupture of muscle or tendon structure of rotator cuff of left shoulder (disorder)|.

If this disorder had the same finding site of |Structure of rotator cuff of left shoulder (body structure)| with two different morphologic abnormalities of |Nontraumatic rupture| and |Complete rupture|, then those two morphologic abnormality concepts can be combined to create a single, primitive, morphologic abnormality concept of |Nontraumatic complete rupture (morphologic abnormality)|. This will prevent modeling with two relationship groups.
