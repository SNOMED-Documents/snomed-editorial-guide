# Pneumonia vs. Pneumonitis

The terms _pneumonia_ and _pneumonitis_ are often used interchangeably. In SNOMED CT, _pneumonia_ is used for infectious causes, and _pneumonitis_ is used for noninfectious causes.

Some concepts may contain a synonym with the other _pneumoni_ - term due to high/common usage in medical literature.

Pneumonia is a type of pneumonitis, as inflammation is present in both. The distinguishing feature between the two disorders is the presence of infection in pneumonia. Pneumonia has a Pathological process (attribute) of Infectious process (qualifier value); Pneumonitis does not.

## Morphologic abnormality

The morphologic abnormality for both [233604007 |Pneumonia (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/233604007) and[ 205237003 |Pneumonitis (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/205237003) is [409774005 |Inflammatory morphology (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/409774005).

The clinically-warranted morphologic abnormality for many subtypes of pneumonia is [707496003 |Inflammation and consolidation (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/707496003). Consolidation is a feature of most forms of pneumonia; however, it may not be a feature of all pneumonias, such as atypical pneumonias.
