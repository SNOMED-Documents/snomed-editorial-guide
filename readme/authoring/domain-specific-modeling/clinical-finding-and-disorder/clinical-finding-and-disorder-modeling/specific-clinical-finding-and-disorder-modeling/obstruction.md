# Obstruction

Since an obstruction describes blockage inside the space of a tubular structure, the Finding site of obstruction concepts should be a value from the 113342003 |Structure of lumen of body system (body structure)| subhierarchy. 

For example,

When modeling gastrointestinal tract obstruction concepts, the Finding site value should be a value from the 432899004 |Structure of lumen of gastrointestinal tract (body structure)| hierarchy as the site obstructed is the lumen of the tract. 

At present, some but not all anatomy content exists to support this model for tracts, ducts and blood vessels beyond the gastrointestinal tract but is expected in the future.
