## Inactive concepts

_Inactive concepts_ are no longer active in the terminology. When the first release format (RF1) was used, inactivated content was moved into this hierarchy. However, this approach is no longer used in the current release format (RF2).

## Navigational concepts

The concepts in navigational hierarchies are used for structured data entry and support the location of concepts in hierarchies. They can order data by priority or another convention (e.g. _cranial nerve order_ or _topics related to diabetes_). Navigational concepts exist only to support navigation.
