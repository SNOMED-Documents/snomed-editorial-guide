# Division, lysis, transection, bisection

### Division and lysis <a href="#division-and-lysis" id="division-and-lysis"></a>

_Division - action (qualifier value)_ is a subtype of Incision - action (qualifier value). This does not mean that all procedures, that include the word _division_, should necessarily be modeled with Method (attribute) of Division - action (qualifier value), like those where the division is accomplished using _blunt dissection_, not incision.

* For example,
  * _Division of adhesion_ concepts, like 173269002 |Division of adhesions of lip (procedure)|, should be modeled the same as _lysis of adhesion_ concept&#x73;_,_ like 45602008 |Lysis of adhesions of peritoneum (procedure)|

Both use _Dissection - action (qualifier value)_. Adhesions are _broken down_ by blunt dissection, often without incising them. This does not exclude procedures that may also involve division by incision.

The preferred name of _division of adhesions_ concepts can be changed to _lysis of adhesions_ for consistency. The use of _lysis of adhesions_ also helps with correct modeling and avoidance of interpreting _divisions_ as necessarily being kinds of incision.

### Transection and bisection <a href="#transection-and-bisection" id="transection-and-bisection"></a>

_Transection_ is defined as a division across the longitudinal axis of a structure by cutting. _Bisection_ is defined as division into two parts by cutting. Transection - action (qualifier value) is a subtype of Bisection - action (qualifier value), which is a subtype of Division - action (qualifier value) and Incision - action (qualifier value).

* For example,
  * 53176004 |Transection of muscle of eye (procedure)|
  * 60158005 |Bilateral bisection of ovary (procedure)|
