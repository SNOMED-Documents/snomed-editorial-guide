# Transplantation

In a transplant procedure, the transplanted organ or tissue may not be in the same place as the original organ/structure, and the original organ/structure may or may not remain in situ.

For example,

* ```
  * 70536003 |Transplant of kidney (procedure)|
  ```

In most kidney transplants, the recipientâ€™s own kidneys remain in situ, but in some cases the kidney is removed. The new kidney is usually placed in the right iliac fossa, but not always; it can be placed in the left iliac fossa, retroperitoneal area, or sometimes within the abdominal cavity.

Due to these reasons, encompassing a variety of scenarios depending on each particular organ and patient, << 24486003 |Structure of transplant (body structure)| is used for the target for 405813007 |Procedure site - Direct (attribute)| for transplantation procedures.

For example,

32413006 |Transplantation of heart (procedure)|

For example,

232973007 |Allotransplant of heart (procedure)|

Consultation established that for tissue transplants, _graft_ and _transplant_ are used interchangeably with the preferred option being grafting procedure, with a transplant description placed as a synonym on the grafting procedure concept.

For example,

27493007 |Peripheral nerve graft (procedure)|
