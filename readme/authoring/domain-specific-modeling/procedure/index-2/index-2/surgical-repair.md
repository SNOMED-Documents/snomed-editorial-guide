# Surgical repair

The definition of _surgical repair_ is restoring, to the extent possible, an anatomical structure, using a surgical action. _Repair_ is an objective or intended accomplishment, not a means (e.g., suturing, transplanting, etc.) nor a need (e.g., normal functioning, cosmetic appearance, pain relief, etc.).

Surgery that restores structure is usually intended to restore function and appearance. Restoring function, however, is not necessary for a procedure to be considered a repair. It is also possible for surgery to restore function without restoring structure (e.g., surgery to attach a prosthetic limb after amputation). This type of surgery would not be strictly categorized as a repair.

The _Method_ (attribute) is used to model both the objective of a procedure and the means used to accomplish it. If a procedure requires both a repair action and another type of action, then two relationship groups should be used.

### Fistula <a href="#fistula" id="fistula"></a>

_Closure_ action is a kind of _repair_ actio&#x6E;_._ All fistula closures use the _closure_ action and are classified as kinds of repair procedures.

* For example,
  * 79433000 |Closure of colon fistula (procedure)| has Method (attribute), Closure - action (qualifier value) with a parent, Repair of colon (procedure)

### Plastic repair <a href="#plastic-repair" id="plastic-repair"></a>

Surgery that accomplishes a _repair_ (a structural restoration) often uses the suffix _-plasty_. The term _plastic repair_ is also used. In order to avoid redundancy, the following terms are use&#x64;_:_

* _Prosthetic repair_, using external (non-body) materials
* _Plastic repair,_ reshaping the body

**-plasty**

The suffix _-plasty_ is widely used in concepts that apply to prosthetic repairs (e.g. total hip arthroplasty). So -_plasty_ may refer to any general repair (prosthetic, plastic, or other) and not just plastic repairs.
