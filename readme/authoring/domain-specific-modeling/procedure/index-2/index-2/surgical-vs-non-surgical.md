# Surgical vs. non-surgical

As mentioned in the initial Surgical procedures page, the definition of surgical procedure includes _intentional non-transient alteration of structures of the body and/or necessarily involves cutting into the body_.

Non-surgical actions do not significantly or non-transiently alter anatomy and do not necessarily involve cutting or incision.

For example,

* Fine needle biopsy (procedure) or brush biopsy (procedure)
  * Phlebotomy, a synonym for venipuncture for blood test (procedure)
  * Aspiration (procedure)
  * Closed reduction of dislocation (procedure)

Closed procedure naming

* The general pattern \<open, closed> is accepted
* When a procedure is specified as closed, the closed procedure should be fully described, e.g. fine needle biopsy, endoscopic, etc.

**Under Revision**

[48635004 |Fine needle biopsy (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/48635004) could be viewed as a kind of _c_ _entesis_ , but the former is non-surgical and the latter is surgical. _Sampling - action (qualifier value)_ , in general, is not necessarily a surgical action. If sampling involves the surgical removal of part of something, then _Surgical biopsy (procedure)_ should be the action.
