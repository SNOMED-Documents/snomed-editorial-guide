# Monitoring

_Monitoring_ of any type is not a notion to be included in SNOMED CT, as it is not really an orderable and clearly not a resultable concept. There are 530 monitoring concepts <239516002 |Monitoring procedure (regime/therapy)| that will eventually be inactivated; new concepts with this label are not to be added.
