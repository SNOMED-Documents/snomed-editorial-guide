# Immunization and vaccination

Immunization may be active (introduction of a vaccine) or passive (introduction of immunoglobulin/antibodies). A _vaccine_ is a substance that can induce active immunity. _Vaccination_ , by definition, is the introduction of a vaccine, and is, therefore, synonymous with active immunization. Some descriptions include the word _vaccination_ , where it is clear that vaccination is intended. Other descriptions have preferred terms with the word _vaccination_ , and synonyms with the word _immunization_ , to include both active and passive immunization.

* For example,
  * 38598009 |Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination (procedure)| has _vaccination_ in all descriptions
  * 86198006 |Influenza vaccination (procedure)| has the synonym, influenza _immunization_
