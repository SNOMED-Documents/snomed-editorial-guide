# Grafting

Although the use of terminology may vary across specialties, in general, grafting is where tissue is completely separated from its source of origin or donor, without its own blood supply, then affixed to a recipient site. The recipient site provides the vascularity.

_Graft of skin_ is

* A section of skin with variable size, thickness, and origin
* Completely detached from its original site and moved to cover the area to be repaired without the benefit of any blood supply

For grafting, the recipient site is represented with the Procedure site - Direct (attribute), and the graft is represented with the Direct substance (attribute).

Fixation or attachment of tissue involves skin, bone, cartilage, or fat, rather than whole organs. The term can also be used for fixation or attachment of synthetic materials (e.g., a bioengineered skin graft is a manufactured skin graft grown in the laboratory from the patient's own cells, other allogeneic or xenogeneic sources, and/or synthetic materials; for example, silicone graft).

For example,

* 783285007 |Full thickness graft of skin to skin of neck (procedure)|
  * Proximal primitive Is a (attribute) value is 71388002 Procedure (procedure)
  * A single relationship group consists of:
    * 260686004 |Method (attribute)| = 129407005 |Grafting - action (qualifier value)|
    * 405813007 |Procedure site - Direct (attribute)| = 43081002 |Skin structure of neck (body structure)|
    * 363701004 |Direct substance (attribute)| = 782792007 |Full thickness graft of skin (substance)|
      * Values for direct substance should be from the 420934007 |Graft of skin (substance)| hierarchy that include the origin of the material in the description.
