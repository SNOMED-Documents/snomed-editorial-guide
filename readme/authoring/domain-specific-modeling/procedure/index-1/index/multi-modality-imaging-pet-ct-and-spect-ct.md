# Multi-modality Imaging: PET, CT and SPECT, CT

There are very few imaging procedures which are truly _multi-modality_ procedures. Two procedures are usually conducted in parallel, rather than as one. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) and Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT), however, are produced by one piece of equipment, possibly by a single technician, but with multiple imaging energies.

## Positron emission tomography with computed tomography 

  * FSN: Positron emission tomography with computed tomography of X (procedure)
  * PT: PET CT of X
  * SYN: Positron emission tomography with computed tomography of X

      * FSN: Positron emission tomography with computed tomography of brain (procedure)
      * PT: PET CT of brain
      * SYN: Positron emission tomography with computed tomography of brain

## Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography

  * FSN: Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of X (procedure) 
  * PT: Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of X 
  * SYN: SPECT CT of X

For example,

* [ 16534151000119105 | Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of liver (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/16534151000119105 "16534151000119105 | Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of liver \(procedure\) |")
      * FSN: Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of liver (procedure)
      * PT: Single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography of liver
      * SYN: SPECT CT of liver
