# Diagnostic Imaging for Multiple Body Sites

## Adjacent structures

Concepts which describe adjacent structures, imaged in one procedure, are acceptable.

For example,

* [432672003 | Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvis and hip (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/432672003)

Multiple procedures or a combination of different procedures in one concept are unacceptable.

## Unacceptable examples

* Computed tomography angiography of aorta, abdomen, pelvis and lower limb
* Ultrasonography of abdomen and ultrasonography of pelvis with transrectal ultrasonography
* Ultrasonography of pelvis and obstetric ultrasonography with transvaginal ultrasonography
* Ultrasonography of knee and Doppler ultrasonography of vein of lower limb
