## Adjacent structures

Concepts which describe adjacent structures, imaged in one procedure, are acceptable.

For example,

* Ultrasonography of abdomen and ultrasonography of pelvis with transrectal ultrasonography
* Ultrasonography of pelvis and obstetric ultrasonography with transvaginal ultrasonography
* Ultrasonography of knee and Doppler ultrasonography of vein of lower limb
