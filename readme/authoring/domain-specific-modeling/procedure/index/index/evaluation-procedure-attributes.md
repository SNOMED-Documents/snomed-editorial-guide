# Evaluation Procedure Attributes

The following defining attributes are unique in the context of the 386053000 |Evaluation procedure (procedure)| subhierarchy. Many of these attributes (e.g., Component, Scale type) are used to define Observable entity concepts. Evaluation procedures may use the attributes below in addition to those attributes allotted to the 71388002 | Procedure (procedure)| hierarchy (see [_Procedure Attributes Summary_](../)).  All attributes for Evaluation procedure concepts should be grouped.  Some of the current modeling does not reflect this guidance. The future of this hierarchy in relation to the observable entity hierarchy is under review. See '[Observable Entity vs. Evaluation Procedure](../../../observable-entity/#observable-entity-vs.-evaluation-procedure)' at Observable Entity.

## Component

Component refers to what is being observed or measured by a procedure.

For example,

* 442091000 | Measurement of ethanol using gas chromatography (procedure)| has 246093002 | Component (attribute)| of 419442005 | Ethanol (substance)|

Although Pharmaceutical / biologic product (product) and its descendants are considered valid values for the Component (attribute), they are not currently used as values for this attribute in the International Release. The only exception is 787859002 |Vaccine product (medicinal product)| and its descendants, which are used as valid values for this attribute.

## Has specimen

_Has Specimen_ indicates the type of specimen on which a measurement or observation is performed.

For example,

* 442165003 | Quantitative measurement of polychlorinated biphenyl in blood specimen using gas chromatography (procedure)| uses 116686009 | Has specimen (attribute)| of 119297000 | Blood specimen (specimen)|

## Measurement method

_Measurement Method_ specifies the method by which an evaluation procedure is performed. It provides additional specificity.  For measurement procedures, the 260686004 | Method (attribute)| is given the value 129266000 | Measurement - action (qualifier value)| . No concept can be defined with a 370129005 | Measurement method (attribute)| unless it is being used to refine a 260686004 | Method (attribute)| that has a value of  129266000 | Measurement - action (qualifier value)| or one of its subtypes that is also specified in the concept definition. That is, use of 370129005 | Measurement method (attribute)| must be **in addition** to a  260686004 | Method (attribute)|  of  129266000 | Measurement - action (qualifier value)| or one of its subtypes.

Also, the 370129005 | Measurement method (attribute)| and its value must be grouped with the 260686004 | Method (attribute)| and its value of the concept or subtype of 129266000 | Measurement - action (qualifier value)| .

For example,

* 442165003 | Quantitative measurement of polychlorinated biphenyl in blood specimen using gas chromatography (procedure)| has a 370129005 | Measurement method (attribute)| of 2842000 | Gas chromatography measurement (procedure)|

## Property

_Property_ specifies the kind of property (quality or characteristic) being measured.

For example,

* 19165008 | Measurement of limb length (procedure)| has a 370130000 | Property (attribute)| of 410668003 | Length property (qualifier value)|

## Scale type

_Scale Type_ refers to the scale of the result of an observation of a diagnostic test.

For example,

* 442165003 | Quantitative measurement of polychlorinated biphenyl in blood specimen using gas chromatography (procedure)| has 370132008 | Scale type (attribute)| of 30766002 | Quantitative (qualifier value)|

## Time aspect

_Time Aspect_ specifies temporal relationships for a measurement procedure.  While this attribute has been approved, guidelines for its implementation await development.

## Further clarification

An evaluation procedure may evaluate a property of a component, or a property may be the sole focus of the method. In the latter case, component isnâ€™t included since only the property is being evaluated.

For example - an evaluation procedure evaluating a property of a component:

* 443834000 | Quantitative measurement of mass concentration of bismuth in urine specimen (procedure)| has 370130000 | Property (attribute)| of 118539007 | Mass concentration (property) (qualifier value)| and 246093002 | Component (attribute)| of 23172004 | Bismuth (substance)|

For example - where property may be the sole focus of the method:

* 78888000 | Osmolality measurement, urine (procedure)|
