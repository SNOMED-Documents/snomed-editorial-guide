# Congenital anomaly

Disorders which involve congenital anomalies are defined with:

* Occurrence (attribute) = Congenital (qualifier value)
* Associated morphology (attribute) = Morphologically abnormal structure (morphologic abnormality)&#x20;
* Pathological process (attribute) = Pathological development process (qualifier value)

Therefore, _congenital_ does not need to be represented as the Associated morphology (attribute) target value.  Congenital anomaly morphology concepts usually have non-congenital parents.
