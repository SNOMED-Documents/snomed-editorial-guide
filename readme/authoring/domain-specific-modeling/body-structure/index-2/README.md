# Morphologic Abnormality Modeling

The morphologic abnormality subhierarchy is located two levels below the Body structure hierarchy with\
siblings Apoptosis and Structure resulting from tissue repair process:

* SNOMED CT concept
  * Body structure (body structure)
    * Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)
      * Apoptosis (morphologic abnormality)
      * Morphologically abnormal structure (morphologic abnormality)
      * Structure resulting from tissue repair process (morphologic abnormality)

The concepts in the morphologic abnormality hierarchy represent abnormal body structures.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Leave Primitive**

The subhierarchy of 118956008 |Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)| is to remain primitive. Authors are not to define morphologic abnormality concepts.
