# Abscess

There are two types of abscesses:&#x20;

1. septic
2. sterile

Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are the result of an infection.

If a concept's meaning, based on its FSN and text definition, does not specify whether the abscess is sterile or septic, then the concept should not be modeled as septic.&#x20;

#### Modeling Abscess in Procedures

The concept's logical definition uses the Indirect morphology (attribute) of 44132006 |Abscess (morphologic abnormality)| and a Direct substance (attribute) of 11311000 |Pus (substance)|.
