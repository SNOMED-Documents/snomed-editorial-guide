# Abscess

There are two types of abscesses:

1. septic
2. sterile

Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are the result of an infection.

If a concept's meaning, based on its FSN and text definition, does not specify whether the abscess is sterile or septic, then the concept should not be modeled as septic.
