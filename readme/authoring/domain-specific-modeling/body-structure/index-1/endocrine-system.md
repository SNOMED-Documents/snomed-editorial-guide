# Endocrine System

The endocrine system is composed of the endocrine pancreas, pineal body, paraganglia, paraaortic bodies, parathyroid glands, endocrine ovaries, endocrine testes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys, and some diffuse neuroendocrine structures. Certain parts of the thymus produce endocrine hormones, but the thymus itself is not part of the endocrine system.
