# Structure of Domain Coverage

SNOMED CT includes 19 _domains_ arranged in a polyhierarchical structure. Each hierarchy is an ordered organization of concepts linked together through _IS A relationships_. Each concept may have one or more parents.

The hierarchical arrangement is helpful for locating concepts, grouping similar concepts, and conveying meaning. For example, if we see the concept _cell_ under the concept _anatomic entity_ we will understand the intended meaning as different than if it appeared under the concepts _room_ or _power source_(Desiderata for Controlled Medical Vocabularies in the Twenty-First Century by J.J. Cimino published in _Methods of_ _Information in Medicine_ 1998:37:394-403).

Concepts are linked to their more general parent concept codes directly above them in a hierarchy. Concepts with more general meanings are usually presented as being at the top of the hierarchy and then at each level down the hierarchy, the meanings become increasingly more specific or specialized.

The domains contain all of the components (clinical, administrative, database structure, as well as other components that express how the domains relate to each other) necessary to create SNOMED CT concepts and maintain the database structure.

## Granularity

The scale, or level of detail, in a terminology is called _granularity_. Concepts and meanings range from very general, or coarse, to very specific, or fine. SNOMED CT has multiple granularities, which is an important component of terminologies that are multipurpose. The broader meanings are useful for aggregation (e.g. Clinical finding, Procedure, etc.), but are not intended for recording individual patient data.

The progressive levels of refinement are used to meet clinical data requirements. There are, however, limits to the degree of precoordination of certain types of complex statements.

In general, concepts in SNOMED CT should name things that exist in the real world. The concepts are usually names or short noun phrases, not complete sentences or paragraphs.

SNOMED CT is intended to be used with electronic health applications that can support full clinical statements, along with their attributions, dates, times, and statement interrelationships. It may be challenging to balance SNOMED CT content with the needs of those using electronic health applications. For example, some older applications may require concepts outside of the scope of SNOMED CT. SNOMED CT tries to maximize its usefulness and at the same time minimize precoordination.
