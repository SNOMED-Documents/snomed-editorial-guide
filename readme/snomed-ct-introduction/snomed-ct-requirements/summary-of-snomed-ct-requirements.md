## Retrieval Requirements

<table><thead><tr><th width="205.25">Requirement</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Analysis</td><td><ul><li><p>Enables the consistent and reproducible storage of information, which is subsequently retrieved for analysis; this requires retrieval that allows the inclusion of subtypes and equivalent codes to be included.

## Data Structure Requirements

<table><thead><tr><th width="196.25390625">Requirement</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Patient Record Architectures</td><td><ul><li><p>SNOMED CT is intended to represent clinical meanings in patient records </p><ul><li>A patient record consists of a series of related statements that are organized under headings </li><li>The statements and headings may contain clinical codes derived from SNOMED CT </li><li>Headings, and other contextual elements, may modify the meaning of related statements </li></ul></li><li><p>The relationship between a terminology, such as SNOMED CT, and a record architecture can be summarized as follows: </p><ul><li><p>SNOMED CT codes and terms may populate different elements in the record structure </p><ul><li>Different SNOMED CT codes may be applicable to different elements in the record </li><li>Some codes may not be appropriate for inclusion in the record </li></ul></li><li>The meaning of a SNOMED CT code may be modified by its context within the record structure </li></ul></li><li><p>SNOMED CT should be evaluated within the context of evolving standards for patient record architectures. Recommendations based on the evaluations may include: </p><ul><li>Possible changes to record architectures in order to realize benefits from SNOMED CT </li><li>Changes to SNOMED CT to better fit into record structures </li><li>Selecting SNOMED CT codes for use in specific record structure contexts</li></ul></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Expression Coordination and Equivalence</td><td><p>Some codes may be entered in a precoordinated or a post-coordinated manner.<br>For example, "excision of ovary" might be entered by:</p><ul><li>selecting the precoordinated code 83152002 |Oophorectomy (procedure)|, OR</li><li><p>alternatively by selecting the codes for</p><ul><li>71388002 |Procedure (procedure)| and adding the qualifying characteristics:<br>260686004 |Method (attribute)| = 129304002 |Excision - action (qualifier value)|<br>405813007 |Procedure site - Direct (attribute)| = 15497006 |Ovarian structure (body structure)|</li></ul></li><li>The coded meanings are stored in the forms entered. This may be using a single precoordinated code, a single post-coordinated expression, or a set of separate codes that together represent the clinical meaning.</li><li>A retrieval query must therefore search for the precoordinated and all possible post-coordinated ways of expressing equivalent meanings. This can be done using the Expression Constraint Language (<a href="http://snomed.org/ecl">http://snomed.org/ecl</a>) and a terminology service that can compute subsumption between expressions.</li><li>These methods for retrieving records based on their clinical meaning rely on the formal definitions of SNOMED CT concepts being as complete as possible. Missing defining characteristics may result in problems with equivalence testing and therefore data retrieval.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

This can also be accomplished by using syntactic representation of identifier combinations; these must be consistent with message syntax and field size limitations</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Mapping Requirements

<table><thead><tr><th width="205.6015625">Requirement</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Classification</td><td><ul><li>Based on recorded codes, mapping tables are used to generate statistical and administrative data </li><li>Automation of the process depends on the nature of the classification, the richness of the mapping table, and the functionality of the mapping software</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Grouping</td><td><ul><li>Mapping tables are used to generate groupings for funding, administration, etc. </li><li>Mapping to a classification, then using the classification codes to generate groupings, is an alternative method</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Communication Specifications</td><td><ul><li>Codes are mapped to specific values, in an enumerated list, associated with a message or communication specification </li><li>Recognizing these mappings may prevent double data entry, when sending or receiving such messages</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Reference Works</td><td><ul><li>Codes are used to establish links with decisions-support protocols or other references </li><li>Mapping between these codes and reference sources may help to facilitate their use</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
