# Congenital anomaly

Disorders which involve congenital anomalies are defined with:

  * Occurrence (attribute) = Congenital (qualifier value)
  * Associated morphology (attribute) = Morphologically abnormal structure (morphologic abnormality) 
  * Pathological process (attribute) = Pathological development process (qualifier value)

Therefore,  _congenital_ does not need to be represented as the Associated morphology (attribute) target value. Congenital anomaly morphology concepts usually have non-congenital parents.
