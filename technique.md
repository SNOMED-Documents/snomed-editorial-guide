[ 272394005 | Technique (qualifier value)|](http://snomed.info/id/272394005 "272394005 | Technique \(qualifier value\) |")

A technique (also called method) is a particular way of performing an activity or task.

While a technique describes  _how_ a specific observation is performed, it should generally not include specific details about what is being observed, i.e., it should not include a component, specimen type, body site, etc. 

Information about  _what_ is being observed would be included in a separate attribute of the Observable entity model. The [Observable Entity Defining Attributes page](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG/Observable+Entity+Defining+Attributes) provides more details about modeling of observables using various attributes.

Reference methods and standardized method protocols are out of scope of the technique hierarchy.
