# Sentence Types

Concepts should be names or short noun phrases. Full statements or sentences are unacceptable. 

Procedure concepts should not contain phrases that can be categorized as a sentence function type, i.e. imperative, declarative, interrogative, or exclamatory. A procedure description should be a noun phrase that names the procedure, and should not contain information that it was done, or is to be ordered, carried out, or planned.

For example,

  *     * [ 11227005 | Excision of ganglion of tendon sheath of hand (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/11227005 "11227005 | Excision of ganglion of tendon sheath of hand \(procedure\) |") is a noun phrase giving the proper description for the procedure

Unacceptable example,

  *     * Hand tendon ganglion excised (situation) indicates the procedure was done, as a past tense declarative statement

This is a situation with explicit context, not a procedure.
