# Descriptions

## Descriptions

A concept has multiple associated _descriptions_.

Each description has a _description type_ and a unique numeric  _description identifier._

Fully specified name (FSN) and synonym (SYN) are description types in SNOMED CT. 

A preferred term (PT) is a synonym that has been marked as preferred in a particular dialect.

Every concept may have only one preferred term in a specific dialect. Two preferred terms for the same language may coexist if they belong to two distinct dialects (e.g. variant US and GB of English language).  

For example,
