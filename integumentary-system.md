## Skin, skin-associated mucosa

This is an example of a body structure that is used to group related terms. The concept [ 707861009 |Structure of skin and/or skin-associated mucous membrane (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/707861009) intentionally employs  _disjunction_ (inclusive O _r_). It includes structures in the deep layers, but excludes non-skin mucosal epithelium, e.g. bronchial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary sites of squamous cell neoplasms. The [400199006 |Structure of skin and/or surface epithelium (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/400199006)**** concept is used to represent the sites of these neoplasms. 

Skin and/or skin-associated mucosa is intended for use in dermatology. It is not intended to subsume all mucosal structures, which are under Mucous membrane structure (body structure).

For the meaning of  _diseases of the skin_ , refer to the draft of ICD-11:  _Diseases of the skin incorporate conditions affecting the epidermis, its appendages (hair, hair follicle, sebaceous glands, apocrine sweat gland apparatus, eccrine sweat gland apparatus and nails) and associated mucous membranes (conjunctival, oral and genital), the dermis, the cutaneous vasculature and the subcutaneous tissue (subcutis)._

## Skin regions, skin of <named body part>

Since the phrase  _skin of finger_ can mean  _some or all of the skin of finger_ (if interpreted as a  _structure_ , rather than  _entire_ in the  _The StructureEntirePart (SEP) model_ , we could use  _IS-A_ to represent the relationship between skin of finger and skin of hand. Thus, skin of finger  _IS-A_ skin of hand,  _IS-A_ Skin structure of upper limb,  _IS-A_  _skin region_. The word  _region_ is not used in all of these names, because it may refer to the  _entire_ region or a  _part of_ a region.

## Scalp

Formal definitions of scalp include layers beneath the skin. Therefore we make a distinction between [ 41695006 |Scalp structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/41695006) and [ 43067004 |Skin structure of scalp (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/43067004).

## Soft tissue

There are at least three different use cases and meanings, and thus categories, for the phrase  _soft tissue._ They include:

  * **Tumors**.  _Soft tissue_ gives rise to similar types of neoplasms of mesenchymal stem cell origin, generally called  _soft tissue neoplasms. _This accounts for the inclusions/exclusions of the category.  _Non-neoplastic masses_ arising in soft tissue are included in the WHO Classification of Soft Tissue Tumours. 
    * For tumors,_ soft tissue_ is defined as non-epithelial extraskeletal tissue of the body, exclusive of the mononuclear phagocyte system, glia, and supporting tissue of various mesenchymal organs. Other explicit inclusions are: fibrous tissue, fascia, ligaments, tendons, tendon sheaths, synovia, bursae, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, fatty tissue, adipose tissue, blood vessels, lymph vessels, peripheral nerves, sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and ganglia, as well as subcutaneous tissue. Skin, skeletal cartilage, pleura, and the pericardium, peritoneum, central nervous system, endocrine glands, and viscera are excluded.

  * **Sites of non-bone disorders and injuries of the limbs, head, neck, and body wall**. Skeletal cartilage, as well as all non-bone structures of the limbs, and subcutaneous tissue and fat are included. Skin and lymph nodes are not included. For the head, neck and torso, mononuclear phagocyte system, central nervous system, endocrine glands, viscera, and supporting tissues are excluded.
  * **Structures identified in images**. Soft tissue include everything except for mineralized bone tissue and teeth.
