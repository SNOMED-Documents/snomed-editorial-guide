# Introduction to the SNOMED CT Editorial Guide

## Background

SNOMED CT is a comprehensive, international, logic-based reference terminology designed to represent clinically relevant information in a consistent, computable way. Originating from the union of NHS Clinical Terms Version 3 and SNOMED RT, it has evolved to support contemporary clinical practice and technological advances . The Editorial Guide exists to support the ongoing development and quality assurance of this terminology, ensuring content is modeled consistently and in alignment with best practices .

## Purpose

The Editorial Guide provides the rules, conventions, and principles required to model SNOMED CT concepts. It serves as the definitive reference for authoring and maintaining content in the International Release, while also supporting extension creators . The guide ensures that terminology is reliable, unambiguous, and interoperable for healthcare applications.

This guide covers the editorial policies for precoordinated content, meaning concepts and rules applicable to all precoordinated SNOMED CT content. Rules specific only to postcoordinated content are not included; these are managed separately through the MRCM ([Machine Readable Concept Model](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/mrcm)) tool . It also provides information on concept modeling, naming conventions, inactivation, attributes, and rules for specific hierarchies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**These guidelines should be applied to new content. While there are many concepts in the existing content that are not in compliance with this guidance, the process of correcting existing content will be carried out as time and resources permit.**_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Editorial Guide publishes only the rules that apply to precoordinated content. That is, the rules where the 'Content Type' is one of the following - |All SNOMED CT content|, |All precoordinated SNOMED CT content|, or |All new precoordinated SNOMED CT content|. The rules that are **not** published in the Editorial Guide are the ones that apply only to |All postcoordinated content|. See the different content types and rules in the MRCM maintenance tool at .
