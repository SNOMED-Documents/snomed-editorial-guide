# Semantic Tag

_Semantic tags_ are part of FSN descriptions. They are placed in parentheses at the end of FSNs when authoring concepts. They indicate the domain to which a concept belongs. For example, body structure, disorder, or specimen.

The purpose of semantic tags is to disambiguate concepts which have the same commonly used word or phrase. 

For example,

  *     * Hematoma (morphologic abnormality)
    * Hematoma (disorder)

The following table contains the semantic tags for each domain.
