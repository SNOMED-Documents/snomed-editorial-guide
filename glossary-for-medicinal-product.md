# Glossary for Medicinal Product

The following definitions and abbreviations apply to this document:

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Active immunity | The usually long lasting immunity which results from the production of antibodies by the immune system within an organism in response to the presence of an antigen. |
| Active ingredient substance | The substance that provides the intended therapeutic effect of the medicinal product; described usually, but not always, without modifiers such as esters, salts or other non-covalent derivatives. |
| Active moiety | The molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. |
| Adjuvant | A substance added to a vaccine to enhance the immune response by degree and/or duration, making it possible to reduce the amount of immunogen per dose or the total number of doses needed to achieve immunity. Often aluminium salts (e.g. aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate or potassium aluminium sulfate), which primarily enhance the immune response to proteins. |
| Administrable dose form | The (pharmaceutical) dose form of a medicinal product for administration to a patient, after any necessary transformation (from the manufactured dose form) has been carried out. |
| Adsorption | The adhesion of atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface. Similar to surface tension, adsorption is a consequence of surface energy. Atoms on the surface of the adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates (the substance that is adsorbed - in vaccines, the antigen). A luminium salts (e.g. aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate or potassium aluminium sulfate) are absorbents in vaccine products; the adsorbent is acting as an adjuvant. |
| Antibody | An immunoglobulin molecule produced by B lymphoid cells with a specific amino acid sequence evoked in humans or other animals by an antigen. |
| Antigen | A substance that, as a result of coming into contact with appropriate cells, induces a state of sensitivity and/or immune responsiveness after a latent period (days to weeks) and that reacts in a demonstrable way with antibodies and/or immune cells of the sensitized subject in vivo or in vitro. [Stedman's Medical Dictionary]. |
| BAN | British Approved Name |
| Basis of Strength Substance (BoSS) | The substance thatis the part of the ingredient that the strength of a given product is based upon; the substance against which the strength quantity of a medicinal product is measured. It may be a base, primary modified base, or secondary modified base. |
| BoSS | see Basis of Strength Substance |
| CDC | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CDC is a major operating component of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. https://www.cdc.gov/ |
| Clinical drug (CD) | Clinical Drug; A representation of a medicinal product based on description of its precise active ingredient substances only and explicitly, the stated basis of strength substance(s) with strength, expressed as presentation strength with unit of presentation or as concentration strength as appropriate, and with its manufactured dose form |
| Combination Grouper | A concept grouping together medicinal products based on both the chemical structure and behavior (mechanism of action) of their active ingredient substance(s) |
| Composite product | PREVPAC ® consists of a daily administration pack containing lansoprazole 30 mg oral capsules, amoxicillin 500 mg oral capsules, and clarithromycin 500 mg oral tablets. Product that contains more than one single or multiple ingredient product packaged together. For example, |
| Concentration strength | A type of strength description where the amount of the basis of strength substance (BoSS) present per unitary amount (volume, mass) of the single clinical drug being represented. |
| Conjugate v accine | Conjugate vaccines combine a weak antigen with a strong antigen (usually a protein/peptide carrier) so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen. Conjugation is usually used for polysaccharide antigens, because polysaccharide antigens on their own produce only a B cell response (they are not whole cells, just pieces of pathogen cell wall). The conjugated peptide stimulate T cells which gives a more vigorous immune response and also promotes a more rapid and long-lasting immunologic memory (e.gHaemophilus influenzae type bconjugate vaccine, meningococcal conjugate vaccine). The carrier protein may be the diphtheria toxoid or the tetanus toxoid. |
| CVX code | The "vaccine administered" code set developed and maintained by the CDC's National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. When paired with a MVX (manufacturer) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. Each code is associated with a status indicating its availability in the United States (e.g. Active, Inactive, Non-US). https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx |

| Disposition Grouper | A concept grouping together medicinal products based on the behaviour (mechanism of action) of their active ingredient substance(s) |
| Dose form (Pharmaceutical dose form) | The physical manifestation or formulation of a medicinal product that contains the active ingredient substance(s) intended to be delivered to a patient; the pharmaceutical dose form may be a manufactured dose form or an administrable dose form |
| GTIN | Global Trade Item Number |
| Hapten | A molecule that is incapable alone of causing the production of antibodies but can, however, combine with a larger antigenic molecule, called a carrier, to form an antigenic complex (see ha pten-carrier complex ). [Stedman's Medical Dictionary, adapted] |
| Hapten-carrier complex | An association between a hapten molecule and an antigen molecule that can stimulate production of antibodies, some of which combine with the hapten portion of the complex. [Stedman's Medical Dictionary, adapted] |
