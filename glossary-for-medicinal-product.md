# Glossary for Medicinal Product

The following definitions and abbreviations apply to this document:

Term| Definition  
---|---  
Active immunity| The usually long lasting immunity which results from the production of antibodies by the immune system within an organism in response to the presence of an antigen.  
Active moiety| The molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.  
Adjuvant| A substance added to a vaccine to enhance the immune response by degree and/or duration, making it possible to reduce the amount of immunogen per dose or the total number of doses needed to achieve immunity. Often aluminium salts (e.g. aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate or potassium aluminium sulfate), which primarily enhance the immune response to proteins.  
Adsorption| The adhesion of atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface. Similar to surface tension, adsorption is a consequence of surface energy. Atoms on the surface of the adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates (the substance that is adsorbed - in vaccines, the antigen). Aluminium salts (e.g. aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate or potassium aluminium sulfate) are absorbents in vaccine products; the adsorbent is acting as an adjuvant.  
Antibody| An immunoglobulin molecule produced by B lymphoid cells with a specific amino acid sequence evoked in humans or other animals by an antigen.  
Antigen| A substance that, as a result of coming into contact with appropriate cells, induces a state of sensitivity and/or immune responsiveness after a latent period (days to weeks) and that reacts in a demonstrable way with antibodies and/or immune cells of the sensitized subject in vivo or in vitro. [Stedman's Medical Dictionary].  
BAN| British Approved Name  
Basis of Strength Substance| The Basis of Strength Substance (BoSS) represents the substance that is the part of the ingredient that the strength of a given product is based upon. It may be a base, primary modified base or secondary modified base.   
BoSS| see _Basis of Strength Substance_  
CD| Clinical Drug  
CDC| Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CDC is a major operating component of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. <https://www.cdc.gov/>  
Composite product| Product that contains more than one single or multiple ingredient product packaged together.For example,

  *     *       * PREVPAC® consists of a daily administration pack containing lansoprazole 30 mg oral capsules, amoxicillin 500 mg oral capsules, and clarithromycin 500 mg oral tablets.

  
Conjugate vaccine| Conjugate vaccines combine a weak antigen with a strong antigen (usually a protein/peptide carrier) so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen. Conjugation is usually used for polysaccharide antigens, because polysaccharide antigens on their own produce only a B cell response (they are not whole cells, just pieces of pathogen cell wall). The conjugated peptide stimulate T cells which gives a more vigorous immune response and also promotes a more rapid and long-lasting immunologic memory (e.g Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine, meningococcal conjugate vaccine). The carrier protein may be the diphtheria toxoid or the tetanus toxoid.  
CVX code| The "vaccine administered" code set developed and maintained by the CDC's National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. When paired with a MVX (manufacturer) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. Each code is associated with a status indicating its availability in the United States (e.g. Active, Inactive, Non-US). <https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx>  
Disposition| A _behavior_ that an active ingredient will exhibit or participate in, given the appropriate contextFor example,

  *     *       * 734727006 |Opioid receptor agonist (disposition)|
      * 734698003 |Beta adrenergic receptor antagonist (disposition)|

  
GTIN| Global Trade Item Number  
Hapten| A molecule that is incapable alone of causing the production of antibodies but can, however, combine with a larger antigenic molecule, called a carrier, to form an antigenic complex (see hapten-carrier complex). [Stedman's Medical Dictionary, adapted]  
Hapten-carrier complex| An association between a hapten molecule and an antigen molecule that can stimulate production of antibodies, some of which combine with the hapten portion of the complex. [Stedman's Medical Dictionary, adapted]  
Herbal medicine product| Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products, that contain as active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant materials, or combinations.<http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/>  
Homeopathic product| An alternative approach to medicine based on the belief that natural substances, prepared in a special way and used most often in very small amounts, restore health. According to these beliefs, in order for a remedy to be effective, it must cause in a healthy person the same symptoms being treated in the patient.[https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&version=19.04f&ns=ncit&code=C15718&key=n1512439168&b=1&n=null](https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&version=19.04f&ns=ncit&code=C15718&key=n1512439168&b=1&n=null)<https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homeopathy/#what-is-homeopathy>  
IDMP| Identification of Medicinal Products; a set of five standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for the identification of medicinal products  
Immunogen| A complete antigen (i.e. can evoke the production of antibodies). Synonym for antigen except that it is sometimes used without the specificity of the serotype (e.g. no statement of valency) whereas an antigen should have the valency specified.  
Immunoglobulin| A class of polypeptide chain proteins in two pairs (one light, one heavy); antibodies are immunoglobulins and most immunoglobulins function as antibodies. The class of immunoglobulins also includes pathological proteins such as Bence Jones or myeloma globulins.  
Inactivated vaccine product| A vaccine product whose antigenic content consists of the disease-causing pathogen that has been inactivated ("killed") usually by heat or by chemicals such as formaldehyde. The pathogen cannot replicate itself at all, but it is still intact and can therefore evoke antibody production (example: polio vaccine).  
INN| see _International Nonproprietary Name_  
International Nonproprietary Name| INNs facilitate the identification of pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients. Each INN is a unique name that is globally recognized and is public property. A nonproprietary name is also known as a generic name.For more information: <http://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/en/>To search for INNs: <https://mednet-communities.net/inn/db/searchinn.aspx>  
Live attenuated vaccine product| A vaccine product whose antigenic content is derived from the disease-causing pathogen but which has been altered to make it less virulent. The pathogen in a live attenuated vaccine has lost its ability to replicate in human cells but still viable to evoke antibody production (e.g. measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, varicella vaccine).  
Monovalent vaccine| A vaccine product that contains a single antigenic serotype  
MP| Medicinal Product  
MPF| Medicinal Product Form  
Multiple ingredient product| Product that contains more than one active ingredient in a single manufactured dose formFor example,

  *     *       * 377265005 |Product containing precisely captopril 50 milligram and hydrochlorothiazide 15 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)|
      * 407853009 |Product containing precisely codeine phosphate 15 milligram and paracetamol 500 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)|

  
MVX Code| The "Manufacturers of vaccines" code set developed and maintained by the CDC's National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. When paired with a CVX (vaccine administered) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. Each code is associated with a status indicating if the manufacturer is currently making vaccines for distribution in the United States (e.g. Active, Inactive).<https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=mvx>  
PCD| Packaged Clinical Drug; the class “below” Clinical Drug in the national extension model  
Passive immunity| The time limited, usually short lived, immunity acquired by direct transference of antibodies into an organism (e.g. by injection of immunoglobulin)  
Polyvalent vaccine| A vaccine product that contains multiple antigenic serotypes; the number of which may be stated (e.g. tetravalent (4), pentavalent (5))  
Precise active ingredient| The actual active ingredient that is contained in the product  
Serotype| A subdivision of a species or subspecies distinguishable from other strains therein on the basis of antigenicity [Stedman's Medical Dictionary]  
Single ingredient product| Product that contains one and only one active ingredient in a single manufactured dose formFor example,

Subunit vaccine| A vaccine product whose antigenic content is a target part of a pathogen (e.g. a specific protein from the pathogen) rather than the whole pathogen, produced either by isolation from the pathogen or by recombinant technology  
Toxoid| A vaccine product whose antigenic content is a toxin produced by a pathogen that has been treated, commonly with formaldehyde, so as to destroy its toxic property but retain its antigenicity (i.e. its capability of stimulating the production of antitoxin antibodies and thus of producing an active immunity).  
Traditional medicine product| Traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. <https://www.who.int/traditional-complementary-integrative-medicine/en/>
