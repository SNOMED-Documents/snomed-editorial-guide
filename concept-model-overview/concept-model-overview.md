| The set of rules that determines the permitted sets of relationships between particular types of concepts | The Concept Model specifies the attributes that can be applied to concepts in particular domains and the ranges of permitted values for each of these attributes. There are also additional rules on the cardinality and grouping of particular types of relationships |
