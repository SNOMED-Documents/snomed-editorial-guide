# Iatrogenic

Adding further concepts to the iatrogenic disorder hierarchy is discouraged. Concepts must have  _iatrogenic_ in the FSN to be modeled with an IS_A relationship to[ 12456005 |Iatrogenic disorder (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/12456005). An iatrogenic disorder should remain as a primitive concept if dependent only upon parent relationships to describe the disorder. In cases where the modeling is explicit, e.g. 202762009 |Iatrogenic cervical spinal stenosis (disorder)|, the concept can be defined. 

For example,
