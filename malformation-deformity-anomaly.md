# Malformation, deformity, anomaly

The word  _anomaly_ is, by itself, ambiguous as it may mean either a structural or functional abnormality, depending on the body structure to which it is applied. Concepts using the term  _anomaly_ must be evaluated to determine whether it represents a structural or functional abnormality. Using the term "anomaly" in new concept FSNs is not allowed. The terms "structural abnormality" should be used when it is unclear whether the morphology results from malformation or deformation. 

A  _deformity_ is a structural abnormality that is due to an extrinsic physical force. Newly created concepts representing a deformity should be considered disorders. 

 _A malformation_ is a structural abnormality that results from intrinsically disordered development. 

For example,

  *     * _Congenital anomaly of <body structure>_ is currently modeled as a structural abnormality but is not the same as _C_ _ongenital malformation_ (structural abnormality due to intrinsically disordered development present at birth). Therefore, it can be regarded as having the more general meaning of  _structural abnormality present at birth_.

When referring to a broad term to denote an intrinsic structural abnormality (e.g., Structural abnormality of fetal bladder) and plan to include 49755003 |Morphologically abnormal structure (morphologic abnormality)| in the model, use the pattern _Malformation of fetal X_ or _Congenital malformation of X_.

  * Genetic, developmental, congenital, and physical origin
  * Acquired abnormality of congenital anomaly
  * Congenital
