{% hint style="warning" %}
Prior to 2023, separate guides existed for (1) Pharmaceutical Dose Form, and (2) Pharmaceutical and Biologic Product. These two separate guides were merged into the Editorial Guide. Thus, the 2022 and prior PDF editions reflect formatting that is variable to 2023 and later editions.
