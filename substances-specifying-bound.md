# Substances specifying bound

## Bound substances Overview

Creation of substance concepts that contain “bound” is limited to the measurement of biological substances (Observable entities, evaluation procedures, LOINC collaboration project) or to report their level (clinical findings).

Where the substance is "bound" the molecule to which the substance is bound to may be specified in the term.
