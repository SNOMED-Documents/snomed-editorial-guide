---|---  
**Preferred Term**|  Preferred Term (US/GB) with initial letter case sensitive:Pattern:

  * X organism RNA

For example,

  *     *       * Norovirus genogroup I

  
**Synonyms**|  Pattern: A synonym that matches FSNFor example,

  *     *       * Ribonucleic acid of Norovirus genogroup I 

  
  
  * Additional synonyms (when a legitimate synonym exists for Organism name) are applicable.
