# Genitourinary system

The genitourinary system includes the entire urinary system, as well as the genital system. The genital system includes internal genital organs and external genitalia. **

## Urinary system/tract

The urinary system includes the organs that form and excrete**** urine, the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The male urinary system includes the prostatic urethra (since it is a male urinary outflow structure).

In common usage,  _urinary system_ and  _urinary tract_ are used interchangeably. However, in SNOMED CT, this is not they case, i.e. they are not synonyms. The two concepts are: [ 122489005 |Urinary system structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/122489005) and [431938005 |Structure of urinary tract proper (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/431938005).

## Urinary tract proper

The urinary tract proper includes the organs involved in the excretion of urine including the renal pelvis (but not the rest of the kidney), ureters, bladder, and urethra. It is used for disorders affecting the flow of urine (as opposed to its formation) or the urothelium, the lining of the urinary tract.

For example, 

  *     * [41368006 |Disorder of urinary tract proper (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/41368006)
    * [249273002 |Finding of urinary tract proper (finding)|](http://snomed.info/id/249273002)
    * [7163005 |Urinary tract obstruction (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/7163005)
    * [255150000 |Carcinoma in situ of urinary tract proper (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/255150000)

## Upper urinary tract

The upper urinary tract consists of the kidneys and the ureters (to the juncture with the bladder). Since upper urinary tract infections include kidney infection, the upper urinary tract must include the kidney.

## Upper urinary tract proper

The upper urinary tract proper is the part of the urinary tract proper. It includes only part of the kidney, the renal pelvis, and the ureters.

For example, 

    * [25990002 |Renal pelvis structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/25990002) has a parent, [431491007 |Structure of upper urinary tract proper (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/431491007).

## Lower urinary tract

The lower urinary tract, [19787009 |Lower urinary tract structure (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/19787009), is the urinary system below the junction of the ureter with the bladder. It consists of the bladder and urethra. Lower urinary tract and lower urinary system are the same. The male and female specific components are located under male urinary outflow structure and female urinary outflow structure, respectively.

## Obstetric and gravid

 _Obstetric and_  _gravid_ body structures should not be added inSNOMED CT.  _Obstetric_ is a context for a disorder, procedure, or medical specialty that is applied to a body structure during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period. The context does not change the body structure.

## Prostate lobes

The  _posterior lobe_ of the prostate is described in newborns but does not persist in the adult. [ 113295002 |Structure of lobe of prostate (body structure)|](http://snomed.info/id/113295002) includes three lobes, left and right lateral, and medial.
