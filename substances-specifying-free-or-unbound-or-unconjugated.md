# Substances specifying free or unbound or unconjugated

## Overview

Creation of substance concepts that contain terms such as “free” (or "unbound" or "unconjugated") is limited to the measurement of biological substances (Observable entities, evaluation procedures, LOINC collaboration project) or to report their level (clinical findings). These concepts are created as siblings of the base concepts with a "substance X and X derivatives" or "X and X compound" as common supertype.
