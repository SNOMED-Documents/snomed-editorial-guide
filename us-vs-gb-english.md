# US vs. GB English

All fully specified names (FSN) should be represented in US English. When there is a difference between the US and GB spelling, there should be US and General British (GB) preferred terms (PT) and/or synonyms (SYN). 

For example:

  *     * FSN: Benign tumor of endocrine pancreas (disorder)
    * PT-US: Benign tumor of endocrine pancreas
    * PT-GB: Benign tumour of endocrine pancreas

## Principles for selecting preferred spelling variants

SNOMED CT may include (or add) more than one description, each with a different spelling for a given concept. That is, if the above references provide evidence of acceptability in the dialects for which they are being added.

For spelling of preferred terms in a dialect, where the reference sources provide multiple options, a judgment about the most common spelling may be needed. This may be determined by reviewing journal articles containing the word in question.

  * Articles should be from highly cited journals, e.g BMJ (for British English) or NEJM or JAMA (for US English). 

  * For concepts that are not clinical, appropriate scientific journals should be consulted, e.g. Science (US publisher) or Nature (UK publisher).

## Fetal vs. Foetal

 _Fetal_ is the preferred term in both the US and GB language reference sets. _Fetal_ is acceptable in GB synonyms. Foetal is not acceptable for US language but acceptable for GB language.
