# Hydrates and anhydrous substances

## Modeling 

**Parent concept**|  Most distal appropriate descendant of 105590001 |Substance (substance)|  
---|---  
**Semantic tag**| (substance)  
**Definition status**|  Primitive  
**Attribute**|  738774007 |Is modification of (attribute)| relationship to the substance with unspecified hydration726542003 |Has disposition (attribute)|, as appropriate  
  
## Hydrates

Hydates are modeled with an [ 738774007 | Is modification of (attribute)|](http://snomed.info/id/738774007 "738774007 | Is modification of \(attribute\) |") relationship to the substance with unspecified hydration. 

For example,

  *     * Ferrous oxalate dihydrate (substance) is modification of → Ferrous oxalate
    * Caffeine hydrate (substance) is modification of → Caffeine
    * Zinc sulfate heptahydrate (substance) is modification of → Zinc sulfate

### Naming Guidelines

**FSN**|  Pattern:

  * X hydrate (substance)
  * X dihydrate (substance)
  * X monohydrate (substance)

For example,

  *     *       * Copper sulfate pentahydrate (substance)

  
---|---  
**Preferred Term**|  Pattern:

  *     * X hydrate
    * X dihydrate
    * X monohydrate

For example,

  *     *       * Copper sulfate pentahydrate

  
  
### Exemplar

The following illustrates the **inferred** view.

Caffeine hydrate (substance) IS MODIFICATION OF Caffeine (substance)

## Anhydrous compounds

Anhydrous compounds have an [ 738774007 | Is modification of (attribute)|](http://snomed.info/id/738774007 "738774007 | Is modification of \(attribute\) |") relationship to the unspecified substance, i.e. where the level hydration is not specified.

For example,

  *     * Sodium carbonate anhydrous (substance) is modification of → Sodium carbonate  

    * Theophylline anhydrous (substance) is modification of → Theophylline

### Naming Guidelines

FSN| Pattern:

  * X anhydrous (substance)

For example,

  *     *       * Theophylline anhydrous (substance)

  
---|---  
Preferred Term| Pattern:

  * X anhydrous

For example,

  *     *       * Theophylline anhydrous

  
Synonyms| Anhydrous X  
  
### Exemplar

The following illustrates the **inferred** view.

Theophylline anhydrous (substance) IS MODIFICATION OF Theophylline (substance)
