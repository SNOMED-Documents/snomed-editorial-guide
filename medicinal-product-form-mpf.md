# Medicinal Product Form (MPF)

Medicinal Product Form - An abstract representation of a medicinal product described by its active ingredient substances and a grouping dose form concept (based on the intended site of administration for the dose form group) but without reference to any product strength. 

The grouping dose form concepts are the immediate children of  [736542009 |Pharmaceutical dose form (dose form)|](http://snomed.info/id/736542009) and are described in detail in the section [Grouper Based on Intended Site](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG/Pharmaceutical+Dose+Form+Grouper+Based+on+Intended+Site). These grouper concepts gather all the formulations (solid, semi-solid, liquid, or gaseous manufactured dose forms) that have the same intended site of administration. The intended site of administration of a dose form concept is a description of the general body site (i.e., not exactly anatomically explicit - no laterality etc.) where the dose form will be administered. 

For example,

  *     * Products formulated with a dose form of _eye drops_ are required to meet various pharmacopoeial standards of sterility, particulate contamination, and pH, as they are intended to be administered to an _ocular_ site.
