# Mass vs Weight

The Property (qualifier value) hierarchy contains the following:

  * 118538004 |Mass, a measure of quantity of matter (property) (qualifier value)|
  * 726527001 |Weight (property) (qualifier value)|

Very rarely is the physics definition of  _weight_ used. When the term  _weight_ is used, it is most often referring to  _mass_ , as further demonstrated by the units of measure i.e., grams, kilograms, etc. Unless units specific to the physics definition of weight are specified using Newtons, assume that mass is implied.

To summarize, always use the  _mass_ qualifier value unless a concept is requested with Newton units that specifically refer to weight.
