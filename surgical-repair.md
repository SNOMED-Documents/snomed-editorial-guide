# Surgical repair

The definition of  _surgical repair_ is restoring, to the extent possible, an anatomical structure, using a surgical action.  _Repair_ is an objective or intended accomplishment, not a means (e.g. suturing, transplanting, etc.) nor a need (e.g. normal functioning, cosmetic appearance, pain relief, etc.).

Surgery that restores structure is usually intended to restore function and appearance. Restoring function, however, is not necessary for a procedure to be considered a repair. It is also possible for surgery to restore function without restoring structure (e.g. surgery to attach a prosthetic limb after amputation). This type of surgery would not be strictly categorized as a repair.

The ___Method_ (attribute) is used to model both the objective of a procedure and the means used to accomplish it. If a procedure requires both a repair action and another type of action, then two relationship groups should be used.

### Fistula

 _Closure_ action is a kind of  _repair_ action _._ All fistula closures use the  _closure_ action and are classified as kinds of repair procedures. 

For example,

  *     * [79433000 |Closure of colon fistula (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/79433000) has Method (attribute), Closure - action (qualifier value) with a parent, Repair of colon (procedure)

### Plastic repair

Surgery that accomplishes a  _repair_ (a structural restoration) often uses the suffix  _-plasty_. The term  _plastic repair_ is also used. In order to avoid redundancy, the following terms are used _:_

  * _Prosthetic repair_ , using external (non-body) materials
  *  _Plastic repair,_ reshaping the body

The suffix  _-plasty_ is widely used in concepts that apply to prosthetic repairs (e.g. total hip arthroplasty). So -_plasty_ may refer to any general repair (prosthetic, plastic, or other) and not just plastic repairs.
