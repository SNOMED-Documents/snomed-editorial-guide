# Substances specifying physical state or physical form

## Overview

Concepts specifying a particular physical state (e.g. liquid, solid, fumes, vapor, crystal, foam) of a substance should be represented as the sibling for the unspecified substance and also have a parent concept that relates to the structure of the substance.

Concepts specifying a particular physical form (e.g. micronized, macrocrystal, microsphere) should have a parent concept that relates to the structure of the substance and also an Is modification of (attribute) relationship to the unspecified substance concept.

## Modeling - Micronized substance

**Semantic tag**| (substance)  
**Definition status**|  Primitive  
**Attributes**|  738774007 |Is modification of (attribute)| relationship to the unspecified substance726542003 |Has disposition (attribute)| as appropriate  
  
## Naming

Fumes should be expressed in the plural (i.e. fumes as opposed to fume).

Fumes and vapor are different and so should not be used as synonyms on the same concept. <https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/gases-vapours-smoke-and-fumes>

**FSN**|  Pattern:

  * X fumes (substance)
  * X micronized (substance)

For example,

  *     *       * Bauxite fumes (substance)
      * Fenofibrate micronized (substance)

**Preferred Term**|  Pattern:

  * X fumes
  * X micronized

For example,

  *     *       * Bauxite fumes
      * Fenofibrate micronized

  
**Synonyms**|  Pattern: X form to represent EN-GB language variants where appropriateFor example,

  *     *       * Fenofibrate micronised
