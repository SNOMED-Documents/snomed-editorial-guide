# Relationship between Observable Entities and NPU codes

_Nomenclature, Properties, and Units (NPU)_ is a coding system and terminology for identification and communication of examination results from clinical laboratories. Please see their website for more information: [NPU terminology](https://www.npu-terminology.org/).

  

Logically there is a relationship between NPU and SNOMED CT observable entities. A pilot project examined overlaps and possible alignment; further work may be done. However, there is no formally maintained SNOMED CT documentation on this alignment.
