# Regimes and therapies

A regime/therapy is a set, sequence, or group of procedures. 243120004 |Regimes and therapies (regime/therapy)| is a subtype of Procedure (procedure). As a subtype of procedure, Regimes and therapies have the same attributes and use the same concept model as general procedures. 

Regime and therapies are either repeated multiple times or performed over an extended period of time.

For example,

  *     * [716872004 |Antineoplastic chemotherapy regimen (regime/therapy)|](http://snomed.info/id/716872004)

This regime/therapy might include individual instances of administration of chemotherapy agents; the instances are at separate, predetermined periods of time. 

  *     * [229586001 |Rest, ice, compression and elevation treatment program (regime/therapy)|](http://snomed.info/id/229586001)

This regime/therapy refers to repeated rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) for an indefinite period of time.

Regime and therapies are focused on a single purpose but do not have any single sub-procedure as a necessary part. 

For example,

  *     * [385695003 |Cast care (regime/therapy)|](http://snomed.info/id/385695003), The sub-procedures are all done for the purpose of properly monitoring and maintaining an orthopedic cast, but the sub-procedures may vary from one cast, patient, or healthcare setting to the next. Sub-procedures may include inspecting the cast, checking the skin, reinforcing padding, etc. There is not a single sub-procedure as a necessary part, although the purpose of the sub-procedures is to take care of a cast.
    * It is possible to have a regime/therapy as an  _instance_ of care. An instance of  _cast care_ could be the specific care for Mr. Smith's cast on the morning of April 23rd, consisting of the set of procedures: examining the cast; examining his arm; asking about his symptoms; and cleaning the skin.

  

_Regime/therapy_ may be the value for the  _Has focus (attribute)_.

For example,

  *     * [385978009 |Cardiac rehabilitation assessment (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/385978009) has a Has focus (attribute) of Cardiac rehabilitation (regime/therapy)
