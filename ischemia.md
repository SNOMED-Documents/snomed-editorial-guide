# Ischemia

## Ischemic disorder

Ischemic disorders are defined by a morphology of ischemic structural change. This need not be permanent, but it is assumed that all ischemia results in some structural alterations at the molecular level.

## Ischemic heart disease

Ischemic heart disease includes myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia (without infarction), angina, and other disorders of the heart that have ischemic structural change (reversible or non-reversible) as a  _defining characteristic_.

Coronary arteriosclerosis can, of course, be present without causing ischemia, so coronary arteriosclerosis is not a  _subtype_ of ischemic heart disease.

Likewise, there are causes of myocardial ischemia and infarction other than coronary arteriosclerosis, so ischemic heart disease is not a  _subtype_ of coronary arteriosclerosis.
