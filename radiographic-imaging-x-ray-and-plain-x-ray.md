# Radiographic Imaging, X-ray and Plain X-ray

## Modeling new content requests

Requests for new imaging-related content must clearly specify an imaging action; for example, computed tomography, plain X-ray, fluoroscopy, etc.  
_Radiographic imaging_ is a broad term that encompasses several types of imaging studies that use ionizing radiation for visualization of internal parts of the body using X-ray techniques (for example, computed tomography) and is therefore a grouping concept. New content requests using the phrase _Radiographic imaging of_ and/or submissions requesting a Method (attribute) of 278110001 |Radiographic imaging - action (qualifier value)| are not acceptable for the international edition of SNOMED CT.

## Approved naming pattern

FSN: Plain X-ray of <body structure> (procedure)  
PT: Plain X-ray of <body structure>

The X is capitalized, and the description case sensitivity is _Only initial character case insensitive_.

The following are acceptable synonyms:

  * Plain film of X
  * Plain radiography of X

These synonyms are only added on request or have been retained as active synonyms where they are already published. They are not routinely included as synonyms for the international edition.

## Unacceptable descriptions

The terms _radiologic_ and _radiologic guidance_ are no longer permitted for any new descriptions, neither FSN nor synonyms. Neither are the following patterns permitted for any new descriptions:

  * Radiography of X
    * For example, 
      * Radiography of hand (procedure)
  * X-ray of X
    * For example, 
      * X-ray of both feet (procedure)
  * Diagnostic radiography
    * For example, 
      * Diagnostic radiography for foreign body detection and localization (procedure)

Existing content with this type of description is currently under review and will be inactivated or updated to align with the new editorial guidance.

[ 363680008 | Radiographic imaging procedure (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/363680008 "363680008 | Radiographic imaging procedure \(procedure\) |") is at the top-level of the hierarchy of imaging procedures utilizing X-rays. This concept is currently under review for inactivation in response to feedback from the community of practice.

## Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry

FSN: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of X (procedure) 

PT: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of X

SYN: DXA of X

SYN: DEXA of X

For example,

  *     * [ 428313006 | Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of mandible (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/428313006 "428313006 | Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of mandible \(procedure\) |")
      * FSN: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of mandible (procedure)
      * PT: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of mandible
      * SYN: DXA of mandible
      * SYN: DEXA of mandible
