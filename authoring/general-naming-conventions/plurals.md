# Plurals

## Fully specified names (FSNs)

In general, concepts are represented in the singular, rather than the plural.

For example:

  *     * Disorder of lung (disorder), not disorder of lungs

    * Acute cholecystitis due to biliary calculus (disorder), not biliary calculi

FSNs should not be plural unless the concept necessarily involves multiples.

## Unintended plurals

 _Unintended plurals_ might be incorrectly interpreted. An unintended plural is the use of a plural when, in fact, there is only one entity.

Correct example,

  *     * _Multiple cranial nerve palsies_ ; the word  _multiple_ indicates that there can never be just one, so the plural  _palsies_ is correct

Incorrect example, 

  *     *  _Trochlear lesion_ versus _trochlear lesions;_ users would use this concept to refer to a single trochlear lesion, thus the plural form would be incorrect

## Exceptions

Organizational nodes or grouper concepts may be plural. 

For example,

  * [ 234320004 | Procedures for splenic lesions (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/234320004 "234320004 | Procedures for splenic lesions \(procedure\) |")
  * [ 194732001 | Diseases of mitral and aortic valves (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/194732001 "194732001 | Diseases of mitral and aortic valves \(disorder\) |") , has IS A [ 195002007 | Multiple valve disease (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/195002007 "195002007 | Multiple valve disease \(disorder\) |")

A concept that necessarily involves multiples should have a plural FSN. 

For example,

  *     * Bilateral atrophy of testes (disorder)

It is advisable to keep track of these exceptions in a separate subset or using a special term type, so that they can be excluded when the singular/plural distinction is important for mapping.
