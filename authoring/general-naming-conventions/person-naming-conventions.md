# Person Naming Conventions

## Patient vs Subject

Descriptions should use the word _subject_ , not _patient_ , if required. Subject is broader than patient.

For example,

  *     * [ 420058008 | Provider of history other than subject (person)|](http://snomed.info/id/420058008 "420058008 | Provider of history other than subject \(person\) |")

_Subject_ refers to the subject of record, who may, in some circumstances, not be the patient.

## Caregiver vs Carer

Descriptions with _caregiver_ should be as follows:

  * An FSN should use _caregiver_ as (one word).
  * There should be a synonym using _carer_.

For example, 

  *     * [ 425578005 | Caregiver able to cope (finding)|](http://snomed.info/id/425578005 "425578005 | Caregiver able to cope \(finding\) |")
    * Synonym: Carer able to cope
