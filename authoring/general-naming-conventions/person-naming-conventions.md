# Person Naming Conventions

## Patient vs Subject <a href="#patient-vs-subject" id="patient-vs-subject"></a>

The |Situation with explicit context (situation)| hierarchy is intended for concepts that explicitly include contextual information.  Context can include whom the finding is about, or on whom a procedure is performed.  These concepts can be used to represent different meanings, e.g., past history, family history, planned care, excluded diagnosis, etc.

In contrast, a concept in the Clinical Finding or Procedure hierarchy has a default [Intended Use](https://conf.spaces.snomed.org/wiki/spaces/DOCEG/pages/133240159) of the subject of the record. This context can be overridden by the information model.

* For example,
  * The concept |Asthma (disorder)| could be used in a family history field to represent a family history of asthma.

However, including the term _subject_ or _patient_ within a Clinical finding or Procedure concept prevents that concept’s context from being overridden by the information model.

* For example,
  * The concept |Patient immunocompromised (finding)| could not be used in a family history field to represent that a family member is immunocompromised.

Therefore, the use of _patient_ and _subject_ should be used only when necessary.&#x20;

Descriptions should use the word _subject_, not _patient_, if required, as _subject_ is broader than _patient_.

* For example,&#x20;
  * [420058008 | Provider of history other than subject (person)|](http://snomed.info/id/420058008)

_Subject_ refers to the subject of record, who may, in some circumstances, not be the patient.

Best practice is to create a contextless concept.

* Example - finding,
  * Patient unable to chew with denture (finding) - incorrect
    * Unable to chew with denture (finding) - correct
* Example - procedure,
  * Positioning subject in supine position (procedure) -incorrect
    * Positioning in supine position (procedure) - correct

## Caregiver vs Carer <a href="#caregiver-vs-carer" id="caregiver-vs-carer"></a>

Descriptions with _caregiver_ should be as follows:

* An FSN should use _caregiver_ as (one word).
* There should be a synonym using _carer_.

For example,&#x20;

* [425578005 | Caregiver able to cope (finding)|](http://snomed.info/id/425578005)
  * Synonym:  Carer able to cope
