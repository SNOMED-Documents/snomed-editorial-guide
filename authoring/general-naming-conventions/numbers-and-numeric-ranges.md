## Numbers and Numeric Ranges <a href="#heading-title-text" id="heading-title-text"></a>

### Roman numerals versus Arabic numbers <a href="#roman-numerals-versus-arabic-numbers" id="roman-numerals-versus-arabic-numbers"></a>

Use the most common representation found in literature for the fully specified name. Use the alternative representation as a synonym, if it is also represented in the literature. If neither representation is common, use the Arabic representation. &#x20;

For example, in the _AMA Manual of Style,_ cancer stages are expressed with the use of capital Roman numerals: stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IV. The term, "stage 0", usually indicates carcinoma in situ.  Histologic grades are expressed with Arabic numerals, e.g., grade 2.

### Numeric ranges <a href="#numeric-ranges" id="numeric-ranges"></a>

In general, content that depends on numeric ranges should not be used for precoordination.

* For example,
  * There may be too many possibilities
    * A finding of number of lesions might have ranges of _1_, _2 to 5_, and _greater than 5_; _1 to 2_, _3 to 10_, and _greater than 10_, etc.
  * There may be possible changes to reference ranges or systems of units
    * The normal serum sodium concentration is usually defined as 135 to 145 mEq/L. Low serum sodium should not use the phrase _serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L;_ it should use a phrase such as _serum sodium concentration below reference range._
    * A body mass index (BMI) score as an indicator of obesity

**Exception: acceptable numeric range**

A standard definition with a fixed numeric range may be acceptable, i.e., the range is an explanation or definition of the score.

* For example,
  * A histologic scoring system with a score of _1_ when there are _0 to 5 mitoses per high power field_, and a score of _2_ when there are _6 to 10_, etc.
  * The Tumor, Node, Metastases (TNM) Classification of Malignant Tumor
