# Immunization and vaccination

Immunization may be active (introduction of a vaccine) or passive (introduction of immunoglobulin/antibodies). A  _vaccine_ is a substance that can induce active immunity.  _Vaccination_ , by definition, is the introduction of a vaccine, and is, therefore, synonymous with active immunization. Some descriptions include the word  _vaccination_ , where it is clear that vaccination is intended. Other descriptions have preferred terms with the word  _vaccination_ , and synonyms with the word  _immunization_ , to include both active and passive immunization.

For example,

  *     * [38598009 |Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/38598009) has  _vaccination_ in all descriptions
    * [86198006 |Influenza vaccination (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/86198006) has the synonym, influenza  _immunization_
