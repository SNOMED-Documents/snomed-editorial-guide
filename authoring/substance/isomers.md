# Isomers

## Overview

Within the substances hierarchy in SNOMED CT there are a number of substances where that is either a mix of isomers of a single chemical, a racemic mix or a single isomer.

  * Omeprazole and Esomeprazole
  * Cetirizine and Levocetirizine
  * Loratadine and Desloratadine

Each of these substances will all need to be represented in SNOMED CT as separate concepts to support the representation of active ingredients in SNOMED CT and should be represented as sibling concepts without any SNOMED CT relationship created between the two substances.

## Exemplar

The following illustrates the hierarchy view for Omeprazole and Esomeprazole:
