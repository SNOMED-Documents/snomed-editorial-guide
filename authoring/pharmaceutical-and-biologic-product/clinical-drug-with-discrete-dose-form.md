# Clinical Drug with Discrete Dose Form

## Overview

Clinical drug concepts representing discrete dose form (e.g., tablets, capsules, pessaries, suppositories, sachets, patches, ampules or vials containing solid dose forms such as powders or granules, and metered dose delivery products such as inhalers and spray) are modeled using _presentation_ strength attributes; concentration strength attributes are not allowed for these concepts in the International Release. Clinical drugs with a discrete dose form using presentation strength represents a medicinal product based on description of 1) its precise active ingredient substances only and explicitly, 2) the stated basis of strength substance(s) with strength, expressed as presentation strength with unit of presentation and 3) with its manufactured dose form.

For example,

  *     * Product containing precisely abacavir 300 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely abacavir 600 milligram and lamivudine 300 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely afatinib (as afatinib dimaleate) 30 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely aztreonam 500 milligram/1 vial powder for conventional release solution for injection (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely flucloxacillin (as flucloxacillin sodium) 250 milligram/1 vial powder for conventional release solution for injection (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely budesonide 200 microgram/1 actuation conventional release powder for inhalation (clinical drug)
    * Product containing precisely nicotine 7 milligram/24 hour prolonged-release transdermal patch (clinical drug)

Pre-filled pens or cartridges are discrete dose forms as they can be counted. In the International edition of SNOMED CT, clinical drugs presenting in pre-filled pens or cartridges are modeled with normalized  _concentration strength_.

Example of pre-filled pen:

  *     * One pre-filled pen for injection contains 2 mg semaglutide in a 1.5 ml solution
    * FSN: 782102009 |Product containing precisely semaglutide 1.34 milligram/1 milliliter conventional release solution for injection (clinical drug)|

When a product has a metered delivery, the strength is "per actuation" not as a concentration. 

For example,

1263426000 |Product containing precisely xylometazoline hydrochloride 140 microgram/1 actuation conventional release nasal spray (clinical drug)|

Lyophilized dose forms are out of scope for the international edition of SNOMED CT.

| Relationship group | One relationship group containing one instance of each of the following attributes is required for each precise active ingredient. |
| Has precise active ingredient | The PAI cannot be modeled as a substance hydrate or solvate unless the BoSS is expressed as a hydrate or solvate. Concepts containing pancreatic enzymes are modeled based on the discrete enzymes; because of variability between real clinical drugs, synonyms representing a total amount in a particular product will not be included in the International Release.

| Has presentation strength denominator value | Concrete Type: Decimal Range: >#0.. Cardinality: 1..1 per relationship group For this pattern, the attribute value is 1. The denominator strength value is required for concepts in theInternational Release even if the value = 1, because including denominators for only some concepts negatively affects the classification results. |
