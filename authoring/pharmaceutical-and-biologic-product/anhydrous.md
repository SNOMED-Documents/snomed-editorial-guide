# Anhydrous

When a clinical drug has a BoSS specified in a Summary of Product Characteristics as an anhydrous substance, the PAI is represented as the unmodified substance, i.e., the substance with an unspecified level of hydration. 

Examples:

  *     * 1153520006 |Product containing precisely **carbidopa anhydrous (as carbidopa) **25 milligram and levodopa 250 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)|

[The SPC](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/7805/smpc#gref) states each tablet "contains 27.0 mg **carbidopa (equivalent to 25 mg of anhydrous carbidopa)** and 250 mg levodopa." The BoSS is anhydrous carbidopa, so the PAI is Carbidopa. 

  

  *     * 1331919008 |Product containing precisely carbidopa anhydrous (as carbidopa) 12.5 milligram and entacapone 200 milligram and levodopa 50 milligram/1 each conventional release oral tablet (clinical drug)|

[This SPC](https://www.hpra.ie/img/uploaded/swedocuments/Licence_PA0711-252-001_09032021145258.pdf) states, "Each film-coated tablet contains 50 mg of levodopa, 12.5 mg of **carbidopa anhydrous (as 13.5 mg carbidopa monohydrate)** and 200 mg of entacapone." The Boss is anhydrous carbidopa, so the PAI is Carbidopa.
