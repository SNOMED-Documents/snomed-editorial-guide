# Continuous presentation: bounded by unit of presentation; solid dose forms

_Examples: vials, ampoules, sachets, containing solid dose forms such as powders or granules which may or may not be dissolved before administration_

The unit of presentation usually either uses the same word (even though it is a different concept) as the (package item) container, or the (package item) container is a more granular concept and the unit of presentation uses a less granular term.  
Strength is expressed as "per one unit of presentation" and the presentation strength and the concentration are exactly the same.

| [Pack size] | 10 vials in the carton |   |
| Precise active ingredient | cefotaxime sodium |   |
| Basis of strength substance | cefotaxime |   |
| Presentation strength (logical) | 2 g per 1 unit of presentation |   |
| Presentation strength | 2 g [per 1 vial] | UCUM: 2 g per 1 each |
| Concentration strength |   | The concentration of cefotaxime in the powder inside the vial is known to the regulatory agency but is not deemed clinically significant. |
