# Lump and mass

Distinguishing consistently between lump and mass can be difficult in diagnostic contexts, as the terms are often used interchangeably or lack precise definitions. As a result, lump and mass have, in certain conditions, been treated as synonymous.

Avoid using 'lump' in new content, where more specific terminology is available.

Lump should not be added as a synonym for mass concepts in the Finding or Disorder hierarchies. Existing legacy synonyms and concepts will remain unchanged for now.
