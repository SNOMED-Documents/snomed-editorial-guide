## Occupation

Interpretation of the meaning of various occupation codes is jurisdictionally specific. International occupation classifications generally do not go to the detailed level that is often required. Job titles are very idiosyncratic and in some cases do not represent the actual occupation, but a ranking or seniority within an occupation. Occupations should be added to national extensions.
