# General Modeling

_SNOMED CT_ is arranged as a polyhierarchy. A _hierarchy_ is defined as an ordered organization of concept codes linked together through IS A relationships. Concept codes are linked to their more general parent concept codes directly above them in a hierarchy. Concepts with more general meanings are usually located at the top of the hierarchy and then at each level down the hierarchy the meanings become increasingly more specialized.
