# Technique

[272394005 | Technique (qualifier value)|](http://snomed.info/id/272394005)

A technique (also called _method_) is a particular way of performing an activity or task.

While a technique describes _how_ a specific observation is performed, it should generally not include specific details about what is being observed, i.e., it should not include a component, specimen type, body site, etc.

Information about _what_ is being observed would be included in a separate attribute of the Observable entity model. [Observable Entity Defining Attributes](../../observable-entity/observable-entity-defining-attributes.md) provides more details about modeling of observables using various attributes.

Reference methods and standardized method protocols are out of scope of the technique hierarchy.
