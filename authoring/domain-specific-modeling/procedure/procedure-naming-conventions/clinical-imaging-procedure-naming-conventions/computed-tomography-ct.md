# Computed Tomography - CT

CT is an exception to the rule that all abbreviations should have their expanded form in parentheses in descriptions.

  

_Legacy issues: Existing computerized tomography concepts will be renamed consistently when the Quality Initiative undertakes improvement of the procedure hierarchy._

**Axial**

Requests for new descriptions with _computerized axial tomography (__CAT)_ are not acceptable. The  _axial_ part of the phrase is no longer accurate, because there are other techniques that also create images on multiple planes or axes. 

**Scan**

Computed tomography descriptions do not routinely include computed tomography _scan of X._

The word  _scan_ is not systematically added in new descriptions and should not be included in preferred terms. However, specific requests to add descriptions with the word  _scan_ are not denied. 

 _Computerized axial tomography scan_ _of X_ is considered obsolete and should not be added as a new description. 

## Computed tomography

  * FSN: Computed tomography of X (procedure)
  * PT: CT of X
  * SYN: Computed tomography of X

For example,

  *     * [ 241566009 | Computed tomography of elbow (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/241566009 "241566009 | Computed tomography of elbow \(procedure\) |")
      * FSN:  Computed tomography of elbow (procedure)
      * PT: CT of elbow
      * SYN: Computed tomography of elbow

CT angiography uses contrast in all cases of the procedure; this must be stipulated in the descriptions.

## Computed tomography angiography with contrast

This naming pattern is used when an anatomical location is specified, but the blood vessel is not explicit. 

  * FSN: Computed tomography angiography of X with contrast (procedure)
  * PT: CT angiography of X with contrast
  * SYN: Computed tomography angiography of X with contrast

For example,

  *     * 582101000119108 |Computed tomography angiography of head with contrast (procedure)|
      * FSN: Computed tomography angiography of head with contrast (procedure)
      * PT: CT angiography of head with contrast 
      * SYN: Computed tomography angiography of head with contrast 

## Computed tomography arteriography with contrast

  * FSN: Computed tomography angiography of [artery] with contrast (procedure)
  * PT: CT angiography of [artery] with contrast
  * SYN: CT arteriography of [body structure] with contrast
  * SYN: Computed tomography arteriography of [body structure] with contrast
  * SYN: CT arteriogram of [body structure] with contrast

For example,

  * 726077005 Computed tomography angiography of bronchial artery with contrast (procedure)
    * FSN: Computed tomography angiography of bronchial artery with contrast (procedure)
    * PT: CT angiography of bronchial artery with contrast
    * SYN: CT arteriography of bronchial artery with contrast
    * SYN: Computed tomography arteriography of bronchial artery with contrast

## Computed tomography venography with contrast 

  * FSN: Computed tomography venography of X with contrast (procedure)
  * PT: CT venography of X with contrast 
  * SYN: CT venogram of X with contrast 
  * SYN: Computed tomography venography of X with contrast 

For example,

  *     * 432842007 |Computed tomography venography of intracranial vein with contrast (procedure)|
      * FSN: Computed tomography venography of intracranial vein with contrast (procedure)
      * PT: CT venography of intracranial vein with contrast
      * SYN: Computed tomography venography of intracranial vein with contrast

 _Venography_ may simply be a timing phase of _angiography_. It is agreed that venography may be a useful term in an FSN, i.e. there may be a meaningful technique difference between _simple angiography_ and _purposeful venography_.

## Computed tomography arthrography 

  * FSN: Computed tomography arthrography of X (procedure)
  * PT: CT arthrography of X
  * SYN: CT arthrogram of X
  * SYN: Computed tomography arthrography of X

For example,

  *     * [ 418940000 | Computed tomography arthrography of intratarsal joint (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/418940000 "418940000 | Computed tomography arthrography of intratarsal joint \(procedure\) |")
      * FSN: Computed tomography arthrography of intratarsal joint (procedure)
      * PT: CT arthrogram of intratarsal joint 
      * SYN: CT arthrography of intratarsal joint
