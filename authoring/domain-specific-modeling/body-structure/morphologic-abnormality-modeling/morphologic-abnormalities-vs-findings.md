# Morphologic Abnormalities vs. Findings

Concepts from the Morphologic Abnormality hierarchy should not be used in place of concepts from the Clinical Findings hierarchy, even though they appear to refer to similar _clinical_ _situations_.

For example,

  *     * [ 4147007 | Mass (morphologic abnormality)|](http://snomed.info/id/4147007 "4147007 | Mass \(morphologic abnormality\) |") is not a finding, but [ 300848003 | Mass of body structure (finding)|](http://snomed.info/id/300848003 "300848003 | Mass of body structure \(finding\) |") is a finding

Morphologies are used as the values of the defining attributes of findings and procedures. Findings are used to represent the combination of a morphology and a location.

For example,

  *     * [ 300923002 | Cyst of scalp (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/300923002 "300923002 | Cyst of scalp \(disorder\) |") represents cystic type of morphology that has the location, scalp

Many morphologies have names that could be misinterpreted as implying a process rather than a structure.

  * Inflammation might mean the _structural-morphologic_ features of inflammation, such as inflammatory cell infiltrates; or it might mean the _process_ that causes the structural changes. Within the morphologic abnormality hierarchy, the _structural_ interpretation is intended, not the _process_ interpretation.
