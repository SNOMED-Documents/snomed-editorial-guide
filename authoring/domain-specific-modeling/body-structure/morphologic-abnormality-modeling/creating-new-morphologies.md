# Creating new morphologies

When considering the creation of a new morphological abnormality concept, consider the following:

  * When the name of a potentially new morphology is the same as the disease, creation of that new morphologic abnormality concept may not be beneficial since it would not be very morphologically descriptive.
  * Determine if there is benefit in creating a new morphology for a very small number of rarely used leaf nodes. If the new morphology is needed to differentiate two non-leaf concepts, that would be sufficient to create the new morphology. Otherwise, use the nearest existing morphologic abnormality. 
  * Including a body site in a morphological abnormality concept is forbidden unless there is a clear modeling and pathological need.
