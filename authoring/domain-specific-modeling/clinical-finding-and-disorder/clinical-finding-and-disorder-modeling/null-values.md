# Null values

## Representing null values

The addition of new precoordinated content in the Clinical finding (finding) hierarchy that specifies null values, such as 'not recorded', is unacceptable.  
There is a use case for recording the reason that data are missing; however, this information should be recorded using a concept from the Qualifier value (qualifier value) subhierarchy rather than a Clinical finding (finding) concept.

New qualifier values of this type should be agnostic as to what data are missing but support the reason why the data are missing.
