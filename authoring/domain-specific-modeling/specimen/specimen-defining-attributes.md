# Specimen Defining Attributes

The following defining attributes correspond to the  _Specimen Attributes Summary_ table.

## Specimen source identity

Specimen source identity specifies the type of individual, group, or physical location from which a specimen is collected.

For example, 

  *     * [ 419695002 | Environmental swab (specimen)|](http://snomed.info/id/419695002 "419695002 | Environmental swab \(specimen\) |") has the Specimen source identity, Environment (environment)

## Specimen source morphology

Specimen source morphology specifies the morphologic abnormality from which a specimen is obtained.

For example, 

  *     * [ 447407009 | Specimen from necrotic tissue (specimen)|](http://snomed.info/id/447407009 "447407009 | Specimen from necrotic tissue \(specimen\) |") has the Specimen source morphology, Necrosis (morphologic abnormality)

## Specimen source topography

Specimen source topography specifies the body site from which a specimen is obtained.

For example, 

  *     * [ 16209771000119101 | Specimen from left lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage procedure (specimen)|](http://snomed.info/id/16209771000119101 "16209771000119101 | Specimen from left lower lobe of lung obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage procedure \(specimen\) |") has the Specimen source topography, Segment of lower lobe of left lung (body structure)

## Specimen procedure

Specimen procedure identifies the procedure by which a specimen is obtained.

For example, 

  *     * [ 384744003 | Lymph node from sentinel lymph node dissection and axillary dissection (specimen)|](http://snomed.info/id/384744003 "384744003 | Lymph node from sentinel lymph node dissection and axillary dissection \(specimen\) |") has the Specimen procedure, Dissection procedure (procedure)

## Specimen substance

Specimen substance specifies the type of substance, pharmaceutical/biologic product, or physical object of which a specimen is comprised.

For example, 

  *     * [ 110897001 | Bone marrow cytological material (specimen)|](http://snomed.info/id/110897001 "110897001 | Bone marrow cytological material \(specimen\) |") has the Specimen substance, Bone marrow fluid (substance)

Although Pharmaceutical / biologic product (product) and its descendants are considered valid values for the 370133003 |Specimen substance (attribute)| by the MRCM, they are not currently used as values for this attribute in the International Release. The only exception is 787859002 |Vaccine product (medicinal product)| and its descendants, which can be used as valid values for this attribute.
