# Physical Object Defining Attributes

The following defining attributes correspond to the  _Physical Object Attributes Summary_ table. 

## Has absorbability

This attribute represents the absorbability aspect of an object.

For example,

  *     * 705633004 |Bioabsorbable vascular stent (physical object)| Has absorbability value of 860574003 |Bioabsorbable (qualifier value)|

## Has coating material

This attribute represents the material with which an object is coated.

For example,

  *     * 717296006 |Polymer coated metal colonic stent (physical object)| Has coating material value of 412155002 |Polymer (substance)|

## Has compositional material

This attribute represents the material or substance of which an object is composed.

For example,

  *     * 257363003 |Metal stent (physical object)| Has compositional material value of 425620007 |Metal (substance)|

## Has device intended site

This attribute represents the site where the device is intended to reside in or on the body.

For example,

  *     * 705472007 |Esophageal stent (physical object)| Has device intended site value of 32849002 |Esophageal structure (body structure)|

## Has filling

This attribute represents the material or substance that fills an object.

For example,

  *     * 464376000 |Saline-filled breast implant (physical object)| Has filling value of 387390002 |Sodium chloride (substance)|

## Has surface texture

This attribute represents the tactile characteristic or appearance of the surface of an object.

For example,

  *     * 769177007 |Saline-filled smooth breast implant (physical object)| Has surface texture value of 82280004 |Smooth (qualifier value)|

## Is sterile

This attribute represents the sterility quality (e.g. sterile or non-sterile) of an object.

For example,

  *     * 716668000 |Non-sterile bare metal esophageal stent (physical object)| Is sterile value of 64100000 |False (qualifier value)|
