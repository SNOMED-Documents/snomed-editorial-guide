Dependence-related concepts which express the current existence of abuse are acceptable.

For example,

  *     * [191816009 |Drug dependence (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/191816009)

Dependence-related concepts which express the pattern as either continuous or episodic are not acceptable. 

Unacceptable patterns:

  *     * X with single episode
    * X with multiple episodes
    * Current episode of X
    * First episode of X
    * X with continuous pattern

Unacceptable legacy concepts:

  *     *       * Drug abuse, continuous (disorder)

      * Episodic drug abuse (disorder) 

Concepts describing  _full_ or  _partial remission_ are acceptable but not the phase of the remission.

Acceptable patterns:

  *     * X in full remission 
    * X in partial remission

For example, 

  *     *       * [46244001 |Recurrent major depression in full remission (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/46244001)
      * [5703000 |Bipolar disorder in partial remission (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/5703000)

Unacceptable patterns:

  *     * X in early full remission
    * X in sustained full remission
    * X in sustained partial remission 

Conditions with associated symptoms should be expressed and modeled like combined disorders.  _Due to _situations are acceptable but not simple  _Co-occurrent._

For example, 

  *     * 703850002 |Delirium due to benzodiazepine withdrawal (disorder)|

Concepts containing X without Y are considered on a case-by-case basis.

Acceptable example:

  *     * [724735003 |Oppositional defiant disorder without chronic irritability-anger (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/724735003)

Unacceptable example: 

  *     * Bipolar type II disorder with current episode moderately depressive without psychotic symptoms
