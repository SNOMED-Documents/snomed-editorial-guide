# Clinical Imaging Procedure Naming Conventions

Almost all imaging procedures can be unambiguously expressed in a number of ways. There is a balance between flexibility in language and efficiency in terminology maintenance. Consequently, all variants for imaging modalities are not routinely included in SNOMED CT. Submissions for additional descriptions must be justified explicitly.

At a minimum, procedures are ordinarily expressed with the modality and body site. Existing content may have inconsistencies, but new content should following the naming conventions that follow.
