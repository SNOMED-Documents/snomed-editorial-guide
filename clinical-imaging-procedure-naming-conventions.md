# Clinical Imaging Procedure Naming Conventions

Almost all imaging procedures can be unambiguously expressed in a number of ways. There is a balance between flexibility in language and efficiency in terminology maintenance. Consequently, all variants for imaging modalities are not routinely included in SNOMED CT. Submissions for additional descriptions must be justified explicitly.

At a minimum, procedures are ordinarily expressed with the modality and body site. Existing content may have inconsistencies, but new content should following the naming conventions that follow.

The use of _near synonyms_ __ is acceptable for clinical imaging procedures: 

For example,

  *     * [ 79516005 | Renal arteriography (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/79516005 "79516005 | Renal arteriography \(procedure\) |") has the synonym renal angiography
    * [ 726077005 | Computed tomography arteriography of bronchial artery (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/726077005 "726077005 | Computed tomography arteriography of bronchial artery \(procedure\) |") has the synonym CT _angiography_ of bronchial artery
    * [ 709552006 | Computed tomography angiography of iliac artery (procedure)|](http://snomed.info/id/709552006 "709552006 | Computed tomography angiography of iliac artery \(procedure\) |") has the synonym CT _angiogram_ of iliac artery
