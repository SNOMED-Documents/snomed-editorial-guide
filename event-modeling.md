# Event Modeling

## Event attributes

When modeling an event, be sure to model the event itself and not the _outcome_ of an event. The _outcome_ of an event would be a finding or a disorder.

## Causative agent

Although Pharmaceutical / biologic product (product) and its descendants are considered valid values for the Causative agent (attribute) by the MRCM, they are not currently used as values for this attribute in the International Release. The only exception is 787859002 |Vaccine product (medicinal product)| and its descendants, which _can_ be used as valid values for this attribute.
